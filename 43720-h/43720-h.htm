<small>A FOREWORD TO MOTHERS</small></h2>


<p>How shall we answer the ever recurring rainy day question, "What shall I
do?" We hear it wherever children are kept indoors&mdash;from whatever
cause. All of us are concerned with the answer&mdash;mothers, fathers,
teachers, big brothers and sisters&mdash;even maiden aunts. We all know
what is coming when Jack turns from the rain-splashed window with a
listless face and Dorothy, none too gently, thrusts her favourite doll
into the corner with its face to the wall.</p>

<p>One might suppose that, with the hosts of mechanical toys, of costly
French dolls, each with a wardrobe as much in keeping with fashion as
that of a society woman, the small sons and daughters would be content
for a year of rainy days. But that proves how little one knows about it.
Such toys are too perfect, too complete,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> and very soon they are
pushed into the background.</p>

<p>The boy's real treasures are the willow whistle that Uncle Tom taught
him to make last summer, the boat that he is building and the game he
invented&mdash;a favourite one with all the children. Bedtime and
getting-up time for the French doll may come and go, while she lies
forgotten in the corner, for is there not a dress to be made for the
clothespin doll?</p>

<p>We need only to look back about twenty years to realise how natural all
this is. What do we remember? Not the toys that were brought us when
father and mother went on a journey. They are very hazy&mdash;these
visions of a doll in silk and lace, and a donkey with real hair and a
nodding head. What became of them afterward? We forget. But the games we
"made up," the paper dolls we cut from fashion papers, the target we
laboured to make of coiled straw&mdash;these are as fresh in our
memories as if we had played with them yesterday.</p>

<p>Shall we not answer the question by giving the children something to do,
not by entertaining them but by helping them to entertain themselves.</p>

<h4><i>A Bean Bag Game</i></h4>

</table></div>

<p>Very many good games can be played with
bean bags. The following is a simple one to
prepare.</p>

<p>Cut from blue gingham three pieces, each five inches wide by twelve
long. Other pieces of the same size are cut from red, yellow and green
gingham&mdash;three of each colour. These pieces are made up into bags
by doubling them and stitching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> up the sides with strong thread;
leaving one end of each open. This will give a small girl something to
do for more than one rainy day.</p>

<p>When they have all been stitched, fill each bag half full of small,
white beans, turn in the edges of the open end and sew it up, over and
over, with strong thread. Be very careful to sew the seams securely, for
if you do you will have a good, durable bag instead of one from which
the beans are always dropping.</p>

<p>The other part of the game is a large ring of rattan ten inches across,
which is made as follows:</p>

<p>Soak a piece of No. 6 rattan in water for a few minutes. While you are
waiting for it to get pliable thread a tapestry or darning needle with
red raffia. Whittle an end of the rattan into a long point. Next coil
the rattan into a ring, ten inches across; lay the end of your raffia,
with its tip turned to the right, on the rattan ring and bring the
needle, threaded with raffia, around and over the ring. The raffia is
then brought under the long end of rattan, around it and down under the
ring, binding the second coil of rattan to the first with what is called
a "Figure Eight" stitch (see Fig. 1). Hold the ring firmly in your left
hand while you sew with the right. First under and around the lower
coil, then up, under and around the upper one. It is pretty work,
besides making such a firm, light ring.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>When you have bound the second coil to the first almost all the way
round the ring, cut the rattan so that it will overlap the beginning of
the ring about an inch, and whittle it to a long, flat point. Continue
the Figure Eight stitch as far as you can, then bind the raffia round
and round the ring, and sew back and forth through the raffia covering
till it is secure. You can then cut it close to the ring.</p>

<p>Fasten a screw eye at the top of the frame of the playroom door and one
on each side of the doorway, on the edge of the frame, four feet
and a half from the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Tie a piece of strong twine, about a yard long, at the top of the ring
and another, three-quarters of a yard, on each side. Fasten the upper
string to the screw eye above the doorway so that the ring will hang
with its lower edge about four feet from the floor. Tie the other
strings through the screw eyes to right and left of the doorway. The
game is now complete. From two to four children can play it. Each has
three bean bags of one colour and takes his turn at throwing them
through the ring, standing on a mark eight feet from the doorway. One
player keeps the score, and whenever a bean bag is sent through the ring
the child who threw it is credited with five points. The one who first
succeeds in making fifty points is the winner.</p>

<h4><i>A Book House for Paper Dolls</i></h4>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left"><strong>Materials Required:</strong> &nbsp; </td><td align="left">A large blank book with a stiff cover, and preferably with unruled pages,</td></tr>
<tr><td></td> <td align="left">A number of old magazines,</td></tr>
<tr><td></td> <td align="left">Some pieces of wall paper the size of the book's pages,</td></tr>
<tr><td></td> <td align="left">Several pieces of lace or other fancy paper,</td></tr>
<tr><td></td> <td align="left">A tube of paste,</td></tr>
<tr><td></td> <td align="left">Scissors.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Any little girl who is looking for a home for a family of paper dolls
will find a book the very best kind of a house for them. And then such
fun as it will be to furnish it! First comes the house hunting. A large
new blank book with unruled pages would be best of all, and that is what
we want if we can get it, but of course all doll families cannot live in
such luxury. An old account book with most of its pages unused will make
an excellent house. I have even known a family of dolls to be cheerful
and happy in an old city directory.</p>

<p>It will be easy to find furniture in the advertising pages of
magazines, rugs can be cut from pictures in the same magazines and bits
of wall paper are used for the walls of the book house. Tissue paper
of different colours and papers with a lace edge make charming window
curtains, while thicker fancy papers may be used for portieres. On the
cover of the book a picture of the house, or just the doorway, may be
pasted. The first two pages are of course the hall. For this you will
need a broad staircase, hall seat, hardwood floor and rugs, with perhaps
an open fireplace or a cushioned window seat to make it look hospitable.
Try to find furniture all about the same size, or if you cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
do this put the smaller pieces at the back of the room and the larger
ones toward the front.</p>

<p>Next there will be the drawing room to furnish, then the library, the
dining room and pantry, not forgetting the kitchen and laundry. Use two
pages for each room, leaving several between the different rooms, so
that the book shall not be too full at the front and empty at the back.
If it does not close easily remove some of the blank pages. Cut out the
different pieces of furniture as carefully as possible, paste them in as
neatly as you can, and you will have a book house to be proud of.</p>

<p>Flowered papers will be the best for the bedrooms, or plain wall
papers in light colours; and with brass bedsteads, pretty little
dressing tables and curtains made of thin white tissue paper (which
looks so like white muslin), they will be as dainty as can be. Now and
then through the book it is interesting to have a page with just a bay
window and a broad window seat with cushions and pillows&mdash;as if it
were a part of a long hall. Hang curtains of coloured or figured paper
in front of it so that they will have to be lifted if anyone wants to
peep in. When you have finished the bathroom, playroom, maids' rooms
and attic there will still be the piazza, the garden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the stables and the golf course (covering several pages), to arrange. If
you have a paint box and can colour tastefully you will be able to make
your book house even more attractive than it is already.</p>

<h4><i>United States Mail</i></h4>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 2</span></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>This is a fine game for rainy days. Any boy can make it and if he
likes to use pencil and paint brush he will find it as interesting to
make as to play with. Get a small pasteboard box about six inches long
by three wide and an inch deep&mdash;such as spools of cotton come in.
Cover it with white paper, pasting it neatly and securely. Then draw and
colour on the lid a mail bag, which should almost cover it&mdash;either
a brown leather sack or a white canvas one with "United
States Mail" on it in large blue letters. Do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
forget to draw the holes at the top of the bag and the rope which passes
through them to close it. You have now something to hold the counters
for the game. These are made to look like letters and postal cards.
To make the letters, rule a set of lines three-quarters of an inch
apart, across a box or cover of shiny white cardboard. Then another
set, crossing the others at right angles. These should be an inch and
a quarter apart. The postal cards are ruled in the same way (on real,
unused postal cards), so as to make oblong spaces. Cut these out with
a sharp pair of scissors. There should be thirty cardboard pieces and
at least twenty-five of the postal cards. Now draw on the cards, with
a fine pen and black ink, marks like those on a postal card&mdash;the
stamp in the corner, the lettering and the address. Make pen lines on
all of the pasteboard letters like Fig. 2 and paint a tiny red dot
on each to look like sealing-wax. On the reverse side of one write
something to look like an address, and paint in large letters "D.L.O.,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
(to stand for Dead Letter Office) in the corner. Six other letters are
also addressed in the same way, but have instead of "D.L.O." a red stamp
and a blue one, the latter wider than it is high, to represent a Special
Delivery stamp. Nine pieces should also be cut from brown cardboard in
the shape shown in Fig. 3 to represent packages. Paint three red stamps
in the corner of each of these.</p>

<h4><i>Rules for Playing United States Mail</i></h4>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 3</span></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Two or more persons can play this game. When the pieces are equally
divided among the players, the one on the right of the dealer throws
a piece on the table, saying as he does so, "I send a letter to
B&mdash;&mdash;," for example, and then counts five, not running the
numbers in together, but as deliberately as a clock ticks. Before he
has stopped counting, the player on his right must name a city or town
beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> with B. If he succeeds in doing this he wins the piece,
otherwise it goes to the player who threw it. When all the pieces have
been played each player counts his score.</p>

<p>The value of the pieces is as follows: Each postal card counts one,
each letter two, each package six. The Special Delivery letters are
worth ten points each, and the person who is so unfortunate as to have
the letter with "D.L.O." upon it loses ten points from his score.</p>

<h4><i>Flying Rings</i></h4>

</table></div>

<p>Boys and girls will enjoy this game, and both can help in making
it. The materials are simple and easily obtained, which is also an
advantage. First of all we shall need a flour-barrel top. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
should be covered with yellow cheesecloth drawn smooth and tight and
tacked in place along the outer edge. Measure with a rule to find the
exact centre and make a pencil mark on the cheesecloth at that point.
Another mark is made above this one, half way between it and the edge. A
third mark is placed at the right of the middle one and half way between
it and the edge, as well as one to the left and one below it at the same
distance from the centre. A large nail is driven into the barrel top at
each of the five marks (see Fig. 4). Two screw eyes are then put in at
the top, about a foot apart, so that it can be easily hung. Next draw on
note paper that is not too stiff the figures 5, 10, 15, 25 and 50. Make
them about an inch high and quite thick and go over them with ink. With
a small pair of scissors cut out these numbers and paste each under a
nail, as shown in Fig. 4.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Next there are the rings to be made. Follow the directions given on
pages 6 and 7, using No. 4 rattan instead of No. 6, and these rings
should only be two and a half inches across. Make three rings of each
colour, green, red and yellow, and the game is complete.</p>


<h4><i>To Play It</i>:</h4>

<p>Hang the barrel top on the wall or against a screen and see who can
throw the most rings on the nails standing six feet away. Each player
has three rings of a different colour, and each in turn throws his rings
at the mark. When he succeeds in tossing a ring on one of the nails he
scores as many points as the number under the nail indicates.</p>

<h4><i>How to Make a Cork Castle</i></h4>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td><strong>Materials Required:</strong> &nbsp; </td> <td align="left">A number of old corks, the larger the better,</td></tr>
<tr><td></td> <td align="left">A tube of glue,</td></tr>
<tr><td></td> <td align="left">A penknife,</td></tr>
<tr><td></td> <td align="left">A piece of pasteboard a foot square,</td></tr>
<tr><td></td> <td align="left">A sheet of dull green tissue paper.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Such fascinating castles can be made from old corks&mdash;or if
you live near a cork factory you can get plenty of odds and ends of
cork bark that will be even better for the purpose. With a penknife
cut small bricks, half an inch long by quarter of an inch wide and an
eighth of an inch thick. If you are planning a round tower, such as
is shown in Fig. 5, make the bricks in the wedge shape shown in Fig.
6. Cut them as nearly alike as possible, but it will do no harm if
they are not perfectly regular; the castle will only look more ancient
and interesting. It is wonderful how much the bits of cork look like
stone.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_040.png" width="500" height="283" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 5</span></p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 6</span></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>When you have a good supply of bricks ready you may begin to build.
Use glue to stick the blocks together; the kind that comes in a tube is
the easiest and cleanest to handle. Leave spaces for doors and windows,
and for the roof use a large flat cork from a preserve jar. Mark it
off into battlements such as are shown in Fig. 5, and cut them out
carefully. Then glue the roof securely on the walls of the castle.</p>

<p>Where shall we place it now that it is made? A green mountain side
is a good location for a castle, and it can be made quite easily. Bend
a piece of pasteboard about a foot square (an old box cover will do)
into dents that will almost break it, these look quite like hills and
valleys and sharp crags, especially when they have been covered with
green tissue paper. To do this spread a layer of paste or glue all over
the pasteboard and then press the paper upon it. If it wrinkles, so much
the better, for it will look more like grass and growing things.</p>

<h4><i>A Doll's Shaker Bonnet</i></h4>

<p>The daintiest little Shaker bonnet may be easily made by a little
girl to fit one of her dolls. From the brim of an old leghorn, or
other fine straw hat, cut two pieces, the shapes shown in Figs. 7 and
8. For a doll six or eight inches long the front piece will need to
be about five inches long by an inch and a half wide. Bind the curved
edge of the front piece with the straw-coloured ribbon, sewing it
through and through with small stitches, using straw-coloured sewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
silk. Sew one edge of a piece of the straw-coloured ribbon close to the
curved edge of the back piece from A to AA (see Fig. 8). Mark, with a
pencil, a dot at the middle of the curved edge of the back portion and
one at the middle of the straight edge of the front part. Pin the two
parts together at these dots and sew the edges together. In doing this
you will have to turn back the ribbon which edges the back portion. Next
bring the ribbon forward to cover the rough edges of the straw where
the two parts join and sew its loose edge along on the front portion.
Cut a piece of China silk seven and three-quarters inches long by an
inch and three-quarters wide. Make a narrow hem all around it. A tiny
pencil mark is then made on the lower edge of the back piece and another
at the middle of the silk strip. Gather the silk just below the hem on
the upper edge and sew it to the lower edge of the bonnet at the back.
Stitch a piece of narrow ribbon eight inches long at each side of the
front, for strings, and the bonnet is done.</p>

<h4><i>Leather and String Puzzle</i></h4>

<p class="clear">With a sharp knife, a small strip of leather and a bit of strong
string any boy can make this simple puzzle. It is easier to make,
however, than it is to do, as the boy's friends will discover. Fig. 9
will show how it is made. A strip of leather five and a half inches
long, an inch and a quarter wide at one end and five-eighths of an inch
at the other, is first cut. Then, starting at about five-eighths of an
inch from the narrow end, cut with a sharp knife two slits down the
middle of the piece three-eighths of an inch apart and three inches
long. At three-eighths of an inch from the wide end a small piece,
one-quarter of an inch square, is cut out of the middle of the strip
(see Fig. 9). From the scraps of leather remaining cut two pieces, each
one inch long by five-eighths of an inch wide. Make a hole in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
middle of each. Then pass a piece of stout linen cord eleven inches long back
of the long, open strip in the large piece of leather, leaving the ends
of equal length. Pass both ends down through the square hole and tie
each of them securely through the hole in the middle of one of the small
pieces of leather. This completes it.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 10</span></p>

</div>

<p>The object is to try to get the string, with the small piece of
leather at either end, off the large piece of leather without cutting or
untying it. The only way to do this is shown in Fig. 10. Holding both
ends of the string, close to where it passes back of the narrow strip
in the middle of the large piece of leather, pull the strip out through
the small square hole. One of the small pieces of leather can then be
slipped through the loop thus formed, releasing the string.</p>

<h4><i>A Bed for a Little Doll</i></h4>

</table></div>

<p>Almost any little girl who chooses to do so can make this dainty bed
for one of her small dolls. She will only need an oblong pasteboard box
with a cover, and large enough to hold the doll comfortably. If mamma
will let her have some pieces of cotton, flowered, striped and plain and
a little cotton or wool wadding, she will have all the materials she
needs.</p>

<p>First cut from blue and white striped cotton a bag the length and
width of the box. Stitch it neatly together around three sides, turn
it right side out and fill it with cotton or wool wadding. Turn in the
edges on the fourth side and sew them together over and over. With a
darning needle threaded with blue cotton or silk the mattress can be
tufted here and there. The needle is first run through to the under
side, then one little stitch is taken, bringing the thread back again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to the right side, where the two ends are tied tightly together and cut
close to the knot. If these tufts are made at equal distances, say one
inch apart, all over the mattress it will make it look very "real."</p>

<p>The pillow is made in the same way as the mattress, except that it
is not tufted. Cut the sheets and pillowcase from thin white cotton,
allowing enough for hems. Make the pillowcase a quarter of an inch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
wider and about an inch and a quarter longer than the pillow. Stitch it
around both sides and on one end and hem the other end. Tiny blankets
may be cut from outing flannel, and a spread made from a piece of white
piqué or other thick white wash material. The bed can now be made up,
but it will look very plain. A fluffy canopy and valance (or flounce)
of flowered or striped white muslin will improve it wonderfully. The
cover is set on end and the head of the bedstead is pressed into it (see
Fig. 11), making a frame for the canopy. Measure from the front corner
of this frame to the middle of the front and cut a piece of muslin half
again as wide as this measurement and long enough to reach from the top
of the frame to the bottom of the bed. Another piece the same size is
cut, and then both are turned in and gathered at the top, hemmed on the
other edges and sewed into place on the top edge of the canopy frame, so
that the two will meet in the middle. They are both looped back against
the front edge of the frame, see Fig. 11, and sewed there securely. The
valance or flounce around the lower part of the bed is cut wide enough
to allow for hemming at the bottom and to turn in at the top. It should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
be long enough to reach once and a half around the bed. Turn in the
upper edge of the valance, gather it to fit the bed and pin it in
position. Then sew it with a strong needle and coarse thread on to the
box through and through. This makes as comfortable and pretty a bed as
dolly could wish.</p>

<p>This is a delightful game for a rainy day, and the preparations
for it are very simple. In fact, when you have fashioned the disk of
lead with a raffia covering, there is nothing to provide but a piece
of chalk. You can buy, from almost any plumber or tinsmith, for a few
cents, a scrap of sheet lead two or three inches square and about as
thick as a half dollar. Upon this piece of lead lay a half dollar, draw
around it with a pencil and cut out the circle with a sharp, strong
pair of scissors. It cuts as easily as cardboard of the same thickness.
Bore a hole one-quarter of an inch across through the centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of the disk with a gimlet or sharp-pointed awl. It is possible to
use the disk just as it is, but it makes less noise if it is covered
with raffia. To do this, thread a worsted (or tapestry) needle with
raffia&mdash;the grass-like material that you have seen used for making
baskets. Tie the other end of the raffia through the disk, as shown
in Fig. 12 A, put the needle down through the hole in the centre, up
through the loop in the raffia (see Fig. 12 B) and pull your strand
up close to the edge. This will make a stitch like that shown in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Fig. 12 C&mdash;what sailors call a half hitch and mothers a buttonhole
stitch. Make more of these stitches around the disk, until finally it is
entirely covered (see Fig. 13). If the strand of raffia gives out before
the disk is covered sew the short end through the last two or three
stitches on the edge of the disk and start a new piece by bringing the
end through the last stitch on the edge. The short ends of both strands
should be covered with the buttonhole stitches as you go on.</p>

the centre of it is a circle, four inches across, which is home. Each
player takes his turn at throwing the disk, standing on a line eight
feet away. If he throws the disk into the space marked 1 he counts that
he has a man on first base; if on 2, that he has one on second; and if
on H, a home run is counted. If by chance with his first and second
throws he puts the disk into 2 and 3 and with the third throw sends it

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Hooked rugs such as our grandmothers used to make are great fun to
do. Why should not a little girl make one of finer materials for the
floor of her doll's house? Either an empty slate frame or a wooden frame
such as is sold by dealers in kindergarten supplies for chair caning
will do very well to hold the canvas of which the rug is made. Instead
of strips of woolen we shall use worsted of various colours, and a
strong steel crochet needle will be needed for "hooking."</p>

<p>When you have decided upon the size of the rug you wish to make cut
a piece of canvas an inch wider and longer than it is to be, and make a
hem a quarter of an inch wide all around it. With a needleful of white
linen thread sew the rug into the frame, taking the stitches through the
edge of the canvas and around the frame until it is securely fastened
in. Suppose a green rug is planned, with a group of white stripes at
each end. It will be well to mark on the canvas where the stripes are
to run before beginning the work. The worsted should be wound into
balls.</p>

<p>Starting with an end of the green worsted, at the lower right side
of the frame, hold it under the rug and hook it up through the canvas
with the crochet needle. Draw up a long enough end so that it can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
be cut off when the rug is finished and leave a thick texture. Do not
make all the loops the same height, for if now and then one is left too
low to cut with the others it will make the rug wear better. One after
another of these loops is drawn through the canvas, leaving two threads
of canvas between every two loops, in a straight line across the rug.
When the edge of the rug is reached a row is made above the one just
finished, bringing the worsted from left to right. So it goes on till
the rug is finished, only changing the ball of green worsted for a white
one when it is time to make the stripes. After the hooking is done, the
tops of the longer loops are cut off with a sharp pair of scissors, so
as to make a smooth, soft rug. It will wear better if it is lined.</p>

<p>When you have completed this rug you may want to make others with
patterns woven into them. Draw the pattern on the canvas with a soft
lead pencil and it will be quite easy to work.</p>

<small>BASKET WEAVING</small></h2>

<p>The rattan of which the baby's go-cart and mother's armchair are
woven came from a far-away forest in India. Troops of monkeys may have
swung upon the very pieces on which your baby brother is bouncing, for
the rattan hung from tree to tree in long festoons. One day some brown
natives cut it down and stripped it of its leaves. It was then packed in
bundles and sent to this country. The hard, shiny bark cut into strips
has been woven into cane seats for chairs, and the inner part or core of
the rattan was cut by a machine into the round strands that you see in
wicker furniture.</p>

<p>It takes a man's strong hands to weave great armchairs and baby
carriages, but boys and girls can make charming little mats and baskets
as well as tiny chairs and tables for the doll's house, and other
interesting things. Dealers in kindergarten supplies sell the rattan
in different sizes, from No. 00, which is as fine as cord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
to No. 7 or No. 8, which is almost as thick as rope. You will only
need the medium sizes, Nos. 2, 3 and 4, for your weaving, with some
raffia&mdash;the soft but strong fibre that the gardener uses for tying
up his plants. This you will also find at the kindergarten-supply store.
A pair of shears, a yardstick and an awl are the only tools you will
need.</p>

 </div>
</div>

<p>Rattan comes in long skeins or twists (see Fig. 15). Always draw it
out from the loop end, so that it will not get tangled and break. Two
sizes of rattan are generally used in making a basket, the thicker for
the spokes or ribs and the fine for the weavers. Both must be soaked in
warm water to make them soft and pliable.</p>

<p>As many spokes as are needed are first cut the required length
and tied together with a piece of raffia. The weavers are then
coiled into rings, so that they also can be soaked. This is done as
follows: Starting near one end of a length of rattan, coil it into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
ring. Twist the short end around this ring once or twice to hold it
(see Fig. 16). Coil the rest of the strand into rings, one above the
other, and twist the other end of the rattan around them all until they
are held securely. Have ready a basin or pail of warm water&mdash;not
hot&mdash;and let the spokes and weaver soak in it for ten or fifteen
minutes.</p>

<p>Feel the ends of your weavers and you will find that some are stiff
while others are almost as soft and pliable as cord. Choose a soft one
to start the mat. The four spokes arranged in pairs are crossed in the
centre, the vertical ones being above the others, or nearer to you.
Place the short spoke, seven inches long, between the upper parts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
these vertical spokes. They are held in position by the left hand, which
is, as always, the one that holds, while the right is the weaving hand.
An end of the weaver (which has first been unwound) is placed along
the horizontal spokes, back of the vertical ones, with its tip toward
the right. The forefinger of the right hand now presses the weaver
across the vertical spokes and down behind the horizontal ones on the
right (thus binding the end of the weaver securely), next over the
lower vertical spokes and behind the horizontal ones on the left (see
Fig. 17). This is repeated, and then, starting with the upper vertical
spokes, the spokes are separated and the weaving begins (see Fig. 18).
If you want to do close, even work, do not pull the rattan as you
weave, but <em>press</em> it with the forefinger, under and over the spokes as
close to the work as possible. The spokes should be very evenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
separated, for upon this much of the beauty and strength of your baskets
will depend. Think of the regular spaces between the spokes of a wheel
and how much trouble one badly placed spoke would make. When there is
just enough weaver left to go around once, the edge is bound off. This
is very much like overcasting.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 18</span></p>

<p>After going under one spoke and over another, the weaver is passed
under the last row of weaving just before it reaches the next spoke. It
then goes behind that spoke, in front of the next and under the last
row of weaving before the next spoke. When a row of this binding has
been made around the edge the mat is finished with the following border:
Cut the spokes all the same length, not straight across but slanting,
so as to make a point that can easily be pushed down between the
weaving. Then hold them in water for a few minutes. When they are quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
pliable the first spoke (any one you choose to begin with) is pushed
down between the rows of weaving beside the one to the left of it or
spoke No. 2. No. 2 is pushed down beside the next one to the left, No.
3, and so on all the way around the mat. Take care that at least an inch
of each spoke is pressed below the edge of the mat.</p>

<p>This little basket may be woven of rattan in the natural colour and
afterward dyed or gilded, or one can buy the rattan already coloured.</p>

<p>Weave a bottom like the beginning of the mat, and when it measures
two inches in diameter (that is, from side to side, across the centre),
wet the spokes and turn them up. The spokes should be turned up away
from you, for the side toward the person weaving is always the outside
of the basket and the weaving should go from left to right&mdash;as you
read. Bend them over the middle finger so that the sides of the basket
will be curved.</p>

joining a new weaver lay it across the end of the old one, back of a
spoke (see Fig. 19).</p>

<p>The weaver at first should not be drawn too tight, but allowed to go
easily, though it must be pressed closely down upon the row beneath it.
When about three-quarters of an inch has been woven up the sides, the
spokes are drawn gradually closer together by a slight tightening of the
weaver, and this should be continued until an inch more has been woven.
Bind off and finish with this border. The spokes for the border should
measure at least four inches from the last row of weaving to the end of
the spoke. Cut and soak as described in the directions for making a mat.
Spoke No. 1 crosses the next one on the left, or No. 2, and is pushed
down beside the next spoke, No. 3. No. 2 crosses No. 3 and is pushed
down beside No. 4, and so on around the basket.</p>

<p>Perhaps you did not think it was as interesting to make a mat as to
weave baskets, but you will be glad you know how to do it when you see
some of the things that can be made with mats. For example, this dear
little wicker table, just the size for a doll's house and the shape for
an afternoon tea.</p>

<p>Two groups of spokes, one of three and the other of three and a half,
are crossed in the centre. The short spoke should be put between two
others, never on the outside of a group. The mat is woven like the other
mat and basket until it is three and a half inches in diameter, when the
edge is bound off. Bring each spoke across the next one and press it
down beside the next, as in the border of the basket, except that the
long end is not cut off, but brought out between the fourth and fifth
rows of weaving on the under side of the mat. The loops of the border
are drawn <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>in so that they will not be more than a quarter of an
inch beyond the weaving. The long ends of the spokes (which are to form
the legs of the table) are brought together and bound with a piece of
fine wire just under the centre. Separate them into three groups of
four spokes each. The odd spoke is either cut off or whittled very thin
and bound in with one of the three groups. A strand of raffia is now
doubled around two or three spokes, above the wire binding, and wound
tightly around one of the groups until it has covered two inches, from
the binding down. At the end a half hitch or one buttonhole stitch is
made, to keep the raffia from slipping. It is then wound up again to
the top. The raffia is brought down the second leg as far as the first
one was wound; here it is turned with a half hitch and brought up again
in the same way. The third leg is also wound down and up again, with
a half hitch at the bottom to hold it. After this third leg has been
covered the raffia is brought in and out between the legs, where they
separate, in order to spread them more. It is then tied and the ends are
cut close. Finally the spokes at the end of each leg are cut slanting so
that the table will stand firmly.</p>

<p>Would you like to make a tiny high-backed chair to use with the tea
table in the doll's house? It is only a trifle more difficult to make
than the table.</p>

<p>Two groups of twenty-inch spokes of No. 3 rattan, one having three
and the other three and a half spokes in it, are crossed at the centre,
bound around twice with a weaver of No. 2 rattan and woven into a mat
three inches in diameter. After binding off the edge the following
border is made: Each spoke is brought down beside the next one, as in
the border of the mat, except that the long end is drawn out between
the second and third rows of weaving on the under side of the mat. When
all the spokes have been brought out in this way underneath the mat, or
seat, the four groups of three spokes each which are to form the legs
are so divided that the vertical spokes in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> centre of the chair seat
shall run toward the front and back of the seat. The thirteenth spoke
is whittled to a thin point and bound in with one of the other groups,
which are wound with raffia down to the end, turned with a half hitch
and brought up again. A neat way to start the raffia is to thread it
across a row of weaving in the chair seat, just above the group it is to
bind.</p>

<p>A piece of No. 3 rattan about nine inches long is coiled into a ring
and held within the space enclosed by the legs, about half way down,
where it is wound around with a strand of raffia and bound securely to
each leg.</p>

<p>The back of the chair is formed by inserting four spokes of No. 3
rattan, ten inches long, beside those in the seat, at that part of the
seat which has been chosen for the back. To do this push a sharp pointed
awl in between the weaving, beside a spoke, draw it out and you will
have made room for the new spoke to run in. Bend the spokes up and weave
back and forth upon them with a No. 2 weaver, turning on the outside
spokes. Needless to say, the weaver must be very soft and pliable in
order to make these sharp turns. You will find that you can make almost
any kind of a back you choose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>If you decide to make an oval-shaped back, then when you have woven
it high enough, bring each of the outside spokes over and down beside
the other one, running it in between the weaving. The inner spokes are
crossed at the centre and run down beside the outer spokes. To make
an armchair insert six spokes instead of four at the back of the seat
and weave the outer spokes in with the others for a few rows. They are
then bent over and forward to form the arms. Each is cut to the desired
length and run in beside one of the side spokes in the seat.</p>

<p>At the Bird Market in Paris charming little nests are sold, woven of
rushes on spokes of brown twigs, in the shape of an Indian tepee. They
are intended for caged birds, who cannot build their own nests of sticks
and grass and horsehair from the fields and wayside. Some free birds
like them, too&mdash;wrens, for example.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>A boy or girl who has made the mat and basket and doll's furniture
will have no difficulty in weaving one of these nests. Then there will
be the delight of hanging it in a tree (not too near the house) and
watching to see what bird will choose it when nesting time comes.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 20</span></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Let us weave a nest that shall be light and yet firm. Spokes of
rattan will give it strength and weavers of raffia will make it soft and
comfortable. Two groups of spokes, one of four and the other of four and
a half, are crossed at the centre, bound three times with a strand of
raffia and woven into a bottom an inch and a half across. Another weaver
is then added and an inch of pairing is made. Pairing, or <i>bam tush</i>,
as the Indians call it, is a simple stitch. Two weavers are started,
each one behind a spoke (see Fig. 20). The one on the left is brought
over the first spoke, under the next and down in front. It is now the
turn of the second weaver, which also passes over the first spoke on its
right, under the next and outside, where it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> held down in front while
the other weaver repeats the process. So it goes on around the nest.
The spokes are then wet so that the bottom may be formed into a bowl
shape, with sides rounding up from the very centre. A row of pairing in
No. 2 rattan is next woven to hold the slippery raffia in place. This
is followed by five-eighths of an inch of raffia woven in pairing, the
sides still being flared. Two rows of pairing in No. 2 rattan are then
woven, drawing the spokes in very slightly. At this point, which is the
widest, the nest should measure eleven inches around the top. A row
of under and over weaving is started, and at the place which has been
chosen for the doorway the weaver is doubled back on a spoke and woven
from right to left until it comes to the second spoke to the right of
the one it first doubled around. It is brought around this spoke, thus
making the beginning of a doorway, which has an unused spoke in the
centre of it. The weaver then returns to the spoke it first doubled
around, where it doubles back again. This is repeated until the doorway
is an inch and a quarter high. Two rows of pairing in No. 2 rattan are
then woven all the way around, forming a firm top for the doorway,
where they cross it. The spokes are drawn in closer and closer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> with
rows of pairing in raffia, until, when an inch and a half has been
woven, they meet at the top. The ends of the spokes are left uneven
lengths and bound around with a strand of raffia threaded through a
tapestry needle.</p>

<p>A loop to hang it by is made of two strands of raffia, five and a
half inches long, covered close with buttonhole stitch in raffia. The
spoke in the centre of the doorway should be cut at the lower part of
the opening, just above the weaving, and after it has been wet until
quite pliable it is bent and pressed up between the weaving beside the
upper part of the same spoke.</p>

<small>KNOTS WITH RAFFIA AND CORD</small></h2>


<p>Sailors' knots are of course fascinating to boys, but why should not
girls enjoy making them, too? Think of the dolls' hammocks, the work
bags and twine ball nets one can make, and think of being able to tie a
good, square knot&mdash;one that will hold&mdash;instead of the "granny
knots" that brothers and boy cousins laugh at!</p>

<p>Of course you know how to tie the simplest knot of all&mdash;the
one shown in Fig. 21. Let us call it the loop knot, for it is made by
tying the ends of a strand together to form a loop. You have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> used
it often for that purpose, I am sure, and sometimes to tie two pieces of
string together. You can make a pretty and useful sponge bag of raffia
in the natural colour with this knot. The wet sponge will not hurt the
raffia, and in such an open bag the air soon dries it.</p>

<h4><i>Knotted Sponge Bag</i></h4>

<p>Roll a length of No. 5 rattan into a ring, as described on page 38,
so that it can be soaked in warm water till it is pliable. Cut it into
three pieces, each forty-seven inches long. Tie an end of one of these
pieces into a ring seven inches in diameter and twist the long end in
and out once around this (see Fig. 22). At the end of this row the
ends, where they meet, should overlap an inch. If they are longer, cut
them off with a slanting cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> and tie them tightly together with a
piece of raffia. Two more rings, the same size as the first one, are
made with the other pieces of rattan. Hang one of the rings where you
can reach it easily, on a low bedpost, for example. Double a strand of
raffia and tie it through the ring as shown in Fig. 21, drawing the knot
up quite close. Twenty-two strands are knotted on in this way. Space
them along the ring about an inch apart, and, beginning with any pair
of strands, tie the right-hand one with the nearest strand of the next
pair on the right, making an even mesh at an inch from the first row of
knots. Continue this all around the ring, when you will have made one
row. Ten more rows are knotted in this way. Then bring the ends of all
the strands straight down together and tie them below the centre of the
ring with a piece of raffia. The ends are cut off evenly at about two
inches and a half from where they were tied, to form a tassel.</p>

<p>The two other rings are used for the handles of the bag. Lay one of
them against the ring at the top of the bag so that the places where the
rings are tied will come together. Thread a tapestry needle with raffia
and bind the rings together with buttonhole stitch for an inch. Then
sew through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> and through the binding to make it secure and cut the end
close to the ring. The other ring handle is bound to the opposite side
of the top ring in the same way.</p>

<p>Even simpler to make than the sponge bag is a doll's hammock of
raffia. It is knotted in just the same way.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_081.png" width="312" height="450" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 23</span></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Lay twelve strands of raffia evenly together. Bend them to find
the middle, or "middle them," as the sailors say. Lay the short end
of another piece of raffia on the middle of the twelve strands, with
its tip turning toward the left, and wind the long end round and round
from right to left, binding them together for two and three-quarter
inches. Bring the two ends of this binding together to form a loop,
wind a strand of raffia tightly around them (see Fig. 23), and tie
the ends securely. You will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> then have twenty-four ends to knot
together, two and two, as the knots in the bag were made. Pin the loop
on the cushion of a chair or tie it to a low hook or to the doorknob, so
that you can pull the strands taut. The first row of knots is tied about
two inches from the loop and after that the rows are only an inch apart.
The finishing of the edge of the hammock is of course different from the
bag.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_082.png" width="398" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 24</span></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>It is done in this way: In starting the second row of knots the left
strand in the first pair is of course left untied, and, after knotting
the row across, the right strand of the last pair is also left free.
When the third row is started the loose strand on the left side of the
hammock is knotted in with the left one in the first pair of strands
in this row (see Fig. 24). In other words, the strands which are left
untied at each side of the hammock when the second, fourth, sixth and
all the even numbered rows have been knotted, are tied in with the
outside strands in the next uneven numbered row. To make a hammock
for a little doll thirteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> rows of knotting will be enough. When
the last row has been tied bring the ends of the strands together, start
a new strand at two inches from the last row of knots, and bind the ends
together tightly for two and three-quarter inches to make a loop like
the one at the other end. After the loop is finished cut the ends close
to the binding, and with a tapestry needle threaded in the end of the
binding strand sew it through and through, to secure it, and cut its end
close to the binding.</p>


<h4><i>How to Tie a Square or Reef Knot</i></h4>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 25</span></p>

</div>

<p>Once upon a time a little girl was carrying a bundle of cookies
by the string, when suddenly the knot slipped and the cookies rolled
in every direction, over the sidewalk and into the street. If the
baker's wife had known how to tie a square knot instead of that
useless "granny," the accident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> would never have happened. I wonder if
you have ever had an experience of this kind. If so, I am sure you will
like to learn how to tie the ends of a piece of string together so that
they cannot slip.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_084.png" width="500" height="188" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 26</span></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Take the ends of a piece of string, one in each hand. Cross them and
bring the upper end down under the long end of the other piece (see Fig.
25). Now turn it back in the opposite direction above the first part of
the knot, to make a loop, and pass the other end down through it (see
Fig. 26). In this way each end of the string will come out beside its
own beginning.</p>


<hr class="tb" />
<h4><i>Two Hitches</i></h4>

<p>There is no simple knot that you will find more useful than the
half hitch. It is described in the directions for making the game of
Floor Baseball in Chapter II. Two of these half hitches, side by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span> side,
are called by sailors a "clove hitch." In making nets this clove hitch
is used to attach the first row of meshes to the top line or head rope,
as it is called.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_085.png" width="500" height="204" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 27</span></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Another use for the half hitch is in the process that sailors call
"kackling" (see Fig. 27). This is used to prevent two ropes from rubbing
against one another, or chafing. A beautiful handle for a basket or bag
may be made with this knot.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_085a.png" width="500" height="236" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 28</span></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 30</span></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Take two pieces of rope and some light cord, or, if it is to be the
handle of a basket, two pieces of heavy rattan, No. 5, and some No. 00
rattan with which to do the knotting. If you use the rattan be sure to
soak it for ten minutes in warm water and choose a soft piece of the
fine rattan for knotting. Hold the heavy pieces of rattan side by side,
lay an end of the fine rattan upon them at the middle (see Fig. 28),
with its tip turning toward the left, and hold it there with the left
hand, while with the right you bring the long end up and around both of
the large pieces of rattan up and under the short end of the fine piece.
It is then brought down and around the two large pieces of rattan and
the end is passed down through the loop made in starting the hitch (see
Fig. 29). Draw the tying strand up tight and bring the long end up and
around the large pieces of rattan and up under the loop it left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> in
starting (see Fig. 30). Take care to keep the fine rattan wet so that it
will be very pliable; if it dries it will surely crack as you tie it.</p>


<hr class="tb" />
<h4><i>Net Making</i></h4>

<p>If you would like to make a ping-pong net or a net for crabbing,
you will find it quite easy to do and very interesting. After you have
made these small nets you may feel like trying a tennis net if you have
plenty of time and patience.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_087.png" width="550" height="198" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 31</span></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>At a hardware store you can buy tightly twisted cord of the size
you wish to use in making your net. It is generally sold by weight.
If you are planning to make a ping-pong or tennis net you will also
need a heavy piece of cord for the head rope. A crab net would of
course be netted on to an iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> ring attached to a long wooden handle. A
needle such as is shown in Fig. 31 may be made quite easily by any boy
who can whittle.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_088.png" width="400" height="387" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 32</span></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>When you have wound your cord on the needle, stretch the head rope
taut between two convenient points, the backs of two chairs, for
example, and begin at the left by tying one end of the cord to it. Make
a loop the size you wish the mesh to be and fasten the cord to the head
rope with a clove hitch, or two half hitches (see Fig. 32). When you
have worked as far as you wish, get on the other side of the net and
work back again. This row of meshes and all that follow after are made
by fastening them to the upper row with a sheet bend (see Fig. 32).
After the second row is finished come around to the other side again and
knot the third row. When the net is wide enough knot it to a piece of
rope the size of the head rope with a row of clove hitches.</p>

<h4><i>The Weaver's Knot</i></h4>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 33</span></p>

</div>

<p>In weaving bead chains on a loom, and in doing other things, you will
often need to tie a new piece of thread or cord to a very short end. The
weavers have a knot they use for this purpose, and as it is a simple
one perhaps you would like to learn it. Hold the old end in a vertical
position (that is, as if it were standing up), lay the new piece back
of it, its short end turning toward the left and reaching an inch or
more beyond the vertical thread. Bring the long end around in front
of the vertical thread, up back of its own short end on the left and
across in front of the vertical thread (see Fig. 33). All these threads
are held in position by the fingers and thumbs of the left hand, while
the right hand brings the thread around. The vertical or old end is now
turned down through the loop in front of it and there held by the thumb,
while with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> fingers of both hands the long and short ends of the new
thread are pulled up tight.</p>


<hr class="tb" />
<h4><i>Turk's Head</i></h4>

<p>There is a beautiful knot called by sailors a "Turk's head." Girls
will find that they can make the prettiest buttons imaginable with it,
using silk cord of any colour, and both boys and girls will enjoy making
napkin rings of rattan with a more open arrangement of the same knot.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_090.png" width="341" height="300" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 34</span></p>

</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_090a.png" width="350" height="306" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 35</span></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>To make a button take a yard of cord, and at about four inches from
one end bend it into a loop (like the one shown in Fig. 34), about
half an inch across. The long end should come above the short one.
Next make a second loop lying above and to the left of the first one
(see Fig. 35), bringing the long end under the short one left in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
starting. The long end is then brought over the left side of the second
loop, under the left side of the first loop, over the right side of
the second loop, under the right side of the first and around to the
beginning, inside of the short end (see Fig. 36). This makes one row,
or the beginning of the button. If you have a bodkin with a large eye,
the long end of the cord can be threaded into it and this will make the
work easier. The next row follows the first one exactly&mdash;close to
it and always on the inside. When the cord has followed in this way four
times, to complete four rows (keeping the button form always in mind and
moulding the cord into that shape), a firm little button will have been
made.</p>

<p>With a piece of rattan in the natural colour or a length of coloured
rattan you can make a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>useful and very pretty napkin ring by following
the directions just given, with only one change. In beginning the second
row (shown in Fig. 36), the long end is brought to the left or outside
of the short end and continues around on that side. Five rows may be
made instead of four. Keep the ring form in mind all the time, have the
rattan wet and pliable and mould it into the shape of a ring, keeping
the top and bottom as nearly the same size as possible.</p>

<h4><i>A Tapestry Needle</i></h4>

<p>When your mother was a little girl her mother used to make with linen
twine a kind of coarse, heavy lace called macramé. One of the knots she
used was called "Solomon's knot," and that is the one you will use if
you decide to make this work bag. A length of No. 4 rattan and a bunch
of raffia, both in a soft shade of green, will be needed. These you
can buy of a dealer in basket materials for a few cents. Twist three
rings like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> those for
the upper edge and handles of the sponge bag described in the first part
of this chapter. Hang one of these rings on a low bedpost or on a hook
placed so that you can reach it easily when seated. Take two strands of
raffia, double them around the ring, and with the four ends thus made
tie a Solomon's knot as follows: Hold the two upper strands straight
and taut. Bend the under strand on the left across them to the right
(see Fig. 37), and bring the under strand on the right over the end of
the left strand, back of the middle strands and through the loop made
by the left strand in starting. Another pair of strands is knotted on
in the same way, and another, until there are twenty-two groups around
the ring. Starting anywhere on the ring, the two strands on the right
of a group are brought beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> the two on the left of the next group
to the right. The middle pair of these four strands are held straight
down, while the strands on the right and left are tied upon them in
a Solomon's knot. This knot should be half an inch from those in the
first row. Make a double knot this time as follows: After tying the knot
(shown in Fig. 37), take the end which is on the right after the first
knot has tied, bring it over to the left, above the middle strands, and
bring the one on the left down over the end of the strand which was on
the right, back of the two middle strands and up through the loop left
in starting the right strand (see Fig. 38). The whole row is made in
this way. Ten rows are knotted, each one about half an inch from the row
above. The bag is finished in the same way as the sponge bag, with a
tassel and two handles. If you choose you can line it with silk of the
same colour as the raffia, or, if it is to be used for a duster bag or
to hold grandmother's knitting, it will not need a lining.</p>

<small>WHAT A CHILD CAN DO WITH BEADS</small></h2>


<p>Long, long ago when the world was young, the child who wished for a
gay and pretty necklace for her little brown throat strung berries and
seeds or pieces of shell and bone that her father ground smooth by hand
and pierced for stringing. For thread there were grasses and fibres of
plants or sinews of deer.</p>

<p>Indian children sometimes used beads of clay, and so did the
little Egyptians, for the fine clay by the river Nile made beautiful
beads, as well as pottery. The children of the North&mdash;the little
Esquimaux&mdash;had beads of amber, and the Indian tribes farther south
strung shells that look so much like the teeth of animals one can hardly
believe they are anything else. Look for them at the Natural History
Museum and you will see that this is so.</p>

<p>Nowadays there are of course many more kinds
of beads&mdash;beads of glass, china, gold and silver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and even of semi-precious stones. After all, though, the child who
lives in the country or by the sea can gather the most interesting kind
of all&mdash;such as were strung by those children who lived so long
ago&mdash;seeds, berries, shells and seaweed. Gather them on a sunshiny
day and store them away for use in the dull hours when you are obliged
to be indoors.</p>

<p>The seeds of muskmelons are soft enough to pierce; watermelon seeds
will take more effort and a stronger needle. Then there are the orange
berries of bittersweet and the red ones of holly. Haws or hawthorn
berries are a beautiful red, too, and perhaps you will find in a
neighbour's garden a bush of Job's tears&mdash;gray, white or brown.
The grape-like seaweed which bursts with a pop when you step on it
makes very pretty beads. Cut each one close to the bulb, yet far enough
to leave a short piece of the stem on each side of the bead. Pierce
the bulbs while they are still wet, and after they have dried for a
few days they will be ready to string. Apple and flax seeds, beans and
peas before they have dried, make excellent beads. A few of the small
glass beads which come in bunches may be used with these natural beads,
and will set them off wonderfully. Although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> they are usually sold in
bunches, eight skeins to a bunch, the skeins can sometimes be bought
separately. Olive-green crystal beads of the size that dealers call No.
3-0 are beautiful with red berries, and what could be prettier to string
with brown seeds or Job's tears than gold-lined crystal beads? Let us
use them in making a chain for a muff or fan.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen any Job's tears&mdash;the interesting
tear-shaped seeds of an East Indian grass?
It grows very well in this climate, and you may
like to raise it yourself. Think of being able to
pick beads from a plant of your own!</p>

<p>Be careful to boil these beads before stringing,
for a little grub sometimes lives in them, and he
may appear when you least expect him or may
even make a meal of the thread on which the
beads are strung. If you have not the Job's
tears, apple seeds will look almost as well, or you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
can buy at the grocer's whole allspice. Use a
No. 5 needle and a piece of No. 60 white linen
thread four inches longer than you wish the chain
to be when it is finished; two yards and a quarter
is a good length.</p>

<p>String a seed and draw it down to the middle of
the thread, then string some of the gold-lined
crystal beads for about three-quarters of an inch.
A seed is next threaded on, and then quarter of
an inch of gold-lined beads. Keep on in this way,
first threading a seed and then quarter of an inch
of gold-lined beads, until there are only two inches
of the thread left. Tie this end through a bead
to keep the others from slipping off. Thread
your needle with the other end of the strand and
start by stringing three-quarters of an inch of
the gold-lined beads, then a seed and quarter of
an inch of gold-lined beads. When this end of
the strand has been strung&mdash;just as the other
was&mdash;to within two inches of the tip, tie the two
ends together and the chain is finished.</p>

<p>Another pretty and simple chain is made of
large rose-pink crystal beads strung on pink raffia;
or you can use seeds or berries
instead of the crystal beads, in
which case the raffia will have
to be split. Tie the strands of
raffia together at one end, and
on each of the other ends
thread a fine darning needle.
String one bead, then pass both
needles through a single bead
and through another and another
(see Fig. 38a). Two beads are
then slipped on each strand
(see Fig. 38a). Next both
needles pass through three beads,
and so on to the end of the
chain. Tie the ends securely.</p>

<p>A double chain like the one shown in Fig 39 may
be made of crystal E beads strung with seeds or
larger beads of a deeper
shade. Measure off a piece
of white linen thread, No.
60, double the length you
wish the chain to be. Three
yards twenty-two inches will
make a chain sixty-five
inches long, which is a good
size. In one end of it thread
a No. 5 needle and string one
large bead, or seed, which
should be pushed down to
the middle of the strand.
Here it may be tied, to hold
it in place. Next string two
inches and a half of E
beads, then another large
bead, or seed, and so on to
the end of the strand, where
the tip is tied through the
last bead. The other end
of the strand is then threaded
and two inches and a half of the E beads are
strung, the needle passes through the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
large bead on the end first strung (see Fig 39),
and two and a half inches more of the E beads are
threaded. So it goes on to the end of the chain&mdash;the
needle always passing through the next large
bead on the strand already strung, after two inches
and a half of E beads have been threaded.</p>

<p>A braided raffia chain with a cluster of three
crystal beads every few inches is so simple that any
little girl can make it. Choose pale green raffia
and beads of a deeper
shade, and it will look
like clover leaves on
their stems. String
twenty-two of the green
crystal beads, No. 0 size,
on a strand of split raffia.
On two other strands
thread the same number
of beads. Tie the thin
end of each piece around
the last bead, so that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
cannot slip off. The other ends are all tied together.
Now pin the knot securely to a cushion,
or tie it to a hook at a convenient height and
braid the three strands together closely and evenly
for about two inches. Then slip a bead
from each piece up close to the work and
braid it in as shown in Fig. 40. This will
make a clover leaf. After braiding two
inches more slip another bead on each
strand up close to the work and make
another leaf. When it is finished tie the
ends together securely.</p>

<p>Next best to making a

is to string one of beads.
And this rainy-day chain

as the real chain would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
hours. First string sixteen green beads, then
eight white ones. Run the needle down through
the first white bead and string a yellow one. Next
pass the needle through the fifth white bead (see
Fig. 41) and draw the thread up tightly. This
makes a daisy. String another stem of sixteen
green beads and make a daisy as you did the first
one. The whole chain is strung in this way.</p>

<p>A chain that is very pretty and effective may be
made with watermelon seeds and pink crystal E
beads, the colour of the inside of a watermelon.
The seeds can be pierced quite easily with a No. 5
needle. Take two pieces of white linen thread,
well waxed, the length you wish the chain to be,
and two needles. Tie an E bead on the end of
each piece of thread. Lay them side by side and
string four more E beads on the strand at the right.
Pass the needle on the left up through the three
middle beads of the five on the right strand (see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Fig. 42), and string one more E bead. Next thread
a seed on each strand and string the E beads in the
same way. So it goes on for the whole length of the chain.</p>

<p>If you are fond of playing Indian and have no Indian costume, you
ought to be happy. That seems a strange thing to say, but the reason is
this: You can have all the fun of making a costume yourself, you can
learn how to do it in the Indian way, and after it is finished it will
be far more like the dress worn by Western Indians than those that are
sold ready made.</p>

<p>Suppose we begin with the belt.</p>

<p>It is woven on a loom&mdash;not an Indian loom,
which, as perhaps you know, was a bow strung with
several strings which served as the warp threads
for the belt or chain. Possibly you have a loom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
your own and know how to use it; but if not you
can either buy one for twenty-five or fifty cents,
or, what is still better, make one yourself. A simple,
good loom may be made from a cigar box.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h4><i>A Home Made Bead Loom</i></h4>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td><strong>Materials Required:</strong> &nbsp; </td> <td align="left">An oblong cigar box, about 2 &frac12; inches deep,</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>Choose a good strong cigar box, one that is quite
shallow, and remove the cover. Rule a line one
inch from the bottom of the box on each long side
and draw a sharp knife across the line several times
until the upper part separates easily from the lower
without injuring it. Smooth the tops of the sides
with sandpaper. Fasten each of the small sticks of
wood inside a corner of the box, to strengthen it.
This is how it is done. Drive one of the half-inch
screws up from the bottom into the end of the
stick, another into it through the side, and two,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
one near the top and one lower down through the
end of the box, into the stick. On the outside of
the box at one end six round-headed tacks are
driven in a row an inch and a half from the top and
about three-quarters of an inch apart. Drive six
screw eyes in the same position on the opposite
side. Cut a row of notches on the top of each end
of the loom, about one-sixteenth of an inch apart,
and deep enough to hold a thread. The loom is
then ready for weaving. Chalk-white beads are
much used by the bead-weaving Indians like the
Sioux and Winnebagos, especially for the ground-work
of their belts. Let us choose them for the
background of the belt and weave the design in
Indian red and blue.</p>

<p>Cut twenty-two pieces of No. 60 linen thread about
six inches longer than you wish your belt to be. Tie
a loop at one end of each piece and slip it over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
round-headed tacks at one end of the loom. Bring
the long ends one at a time through twenty-two
of the notches at the top of the loom and stretch
them across to the notches in the opposite end.
Draw them taut and tie them through the screw
eyes. These make the warp threads for the belt.
As you will see by the pattern, the belt is twenty-one
beads wide and you have twenty-two threads.
This is so that there will be a thread on each side
of every bead. Thread the needle with No. 90
white linen thread. Tie one end of it to the warp
thread on the left (as you hold the loom with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
end on which are the screw eyes toward you).
Bring the needle out to the right below the warp
strands, string twenty-one white beads and press
them up between the warp strands, so that one bead
will come between every two threads. Run the
needle back from right to left through the beads,
making sure that it goes <em>above</em> the warp threads.
This makes one row. The whole belt is woven in
the same way, except that when the figure begins
the beads should be strung according to the pattern.
For example, in making the first row of the pattern
shown in Fig. 43, you will string nine white
beads, three Indian-red ones and nine more of the
white. The next two rows will be the same, and
then you will string six white beads, three Indian-red,
three blue, three Indian-red, and six white.
Wax the thread you weave with, so that the sharp-edged
beads will not cut it. In joining new needlefuls
use the weaver's knot shown on p. 66. Armlets
are woven in the same way, but much wider&mdash;about
forty beads wide and long enough to
go around the upper part of the arm. Tie
them together with strips of chamois, knotted
in with the ends of the warp strands. Head
bands, bracelets and chains are also woven in
this way.</p>

<p>Although this shirt and the moccasins and
leggings that go with it are so simple to make, you
are almost sure to need the help of your mother
or governess in planning and cutting them. The
shirt is the size for a child of seven or eight, but it
can easily be enlarged so as to fit a boy of twelve
or fourteen. It is made by the pattern shown in
Fig. 44, which is drawn on the scale of one inch
to a foot. One large chamois skin and two of
medium size will be needed. Double the large
skin lengthwise to cut the upper part of the shirt.
This should be ten inches deep and a yard wide.
Cut at the centre a slit about nine inches long for
the neck. The ends form the sleeves. Lay the
two smaller skins together and cut from them the
lower portion of the shirt. The back and front
are alike, each measuring nineteen inches wide at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the top, twenty-two inches at the bottom, and
fifteen inches deep. Make a pencil mark at the
centre of each lower edge of the upper part and
one at the middle of the top of both of the lower
pieces. Turn up an inch at each lower edge of
the upper part of the shirt and baste the doubled
edge of one side against the top of one of the lower
parts, keeping the pencil marks at the middle of
each together. Sew the edges together over and
over with No. 90 white linen thread. Join the other
side in the same way. The overlapping edges of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the upper part of the shirt should be kept on the
right side. Sew the sides of the shirt together
with a row of backstitching, four inches from the
edge. The edges are cut into a fringe four and a
half inches deep at the ends of the sleeves and three
inches on the sides and bottom of the shirt. The edges
of the upper part which hangs over the lower
are also cut into a short fringe. Work two
narrow bands of bead embroidery round the neck,
and if you like you can also work a band half way
down the lower part of the shirt and one near the
lower edge just above the fringe. They are made
in this way: Thread a No. 11 needle with white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
linen thread and make a knot at the other end.
Start at the right of the neck close to the edge.
Bring the needle through to the outside of the
shirt. String four beads, press them down close
to the shirt and bring the needle through to the
inside. This makes a stitch which runs up and
down at right angles with the neck opening. Bring
the needle out again on a line with the place where
it went in and close beside it, string four more
beads, bring it up and run it in again just at the
left of where the work began (see Fig. 45). This
simple stitch is the one that is most used by the
Indians in embroidering their buckskin shirts,
leggings and moccasins. String different colours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
according to the pattern. Several designs
for this work are shown in Figs. 46, 47
and 48. If you wish to decorate the shirt
still more, cut strips of chamois about a
quarter of an inch wide and five inches long,
pierce a row of holes, two together, at
intervals of an inch and three-quarters
across the shirt (see Fig. 44), bring the
strips of chamois through them and tie
them once. String a large Indian-red bead
on each end and tie a knot to keep it from
falling off.</p>

the edge that laps over and across the bottom. Six strands of chamois
about eight inches long are brought through the leggings on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>

<p>To make the pattern for these moccasins you
need only stand on a sheet of brown paper and
draw with a pencil around your bare foot so as
to get its exact size and natural form. Cut the
pattern out and take it to a shoemaker, who will
cut from it a pair of leather soles. The uppers
you can cut from a paper pattern copied from the
shape shown in Fig. 52. It will not be difficult
to plan them to fit the soles, for you have only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
measure the distance around the outer edge of
the soles and make the uppers measure about an
inch more along the outer edge, to allow for the
seam at the back and for a little fulness across the toe.
Work them in some simple design, like the one shown
in Fig. 53. A pretty beaded edge is made with a
stitch which is very like the one used in working the bands.
Thread a needle with No. 90 white linen thread and bring it
through the top of the moccasin close to the
edge. Fasten the end by taking two or three
small stitches. String six beads of a colour
used in working the bands and bring the
needle through the edge from the inside of
the moccasin out, about a quarter of an
inch from the beginning, making the stitch
shown in Fig. 54. Before starting the next stitch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
pass the needle under the first one. Work the whole upper edge of the
moccasin in this way, then stitch it together up the back, making a seam
a quarter of an inch wide. It should be stitched on the inside and then
turned right side out. The uppers are stitched on to the soles with
a No. 3 needle and a well-waxed piece of white linen thread, No. 25.
Should this prove too hard work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span> for small fingers the
moccasins may be taken to a shoemaker to finish.</p>

<p>The daintiest little silk bag may be made by
any small daughter for mamma or a dearly-loved
aunt to carry a bit of lace work or some other
treasure. A piece of soft ribbon five inches wide
and seven and three-quarters inches long in a pale
shade of lavender makes a charming bag. A network
of lavender crystal beads of the same shade,
with a pearl or gold-lined crystal bead at the
point of each diamond-shaped mesh, gives the
finishing touch of daintiness (see Fig. 55). Start
by threading a fine needle with a piece of sewing
silk the colour of the bag. Fasten the end by
taking one or two small stitches near the left side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of the strip of silk at about two inches from the
lower edge. String six lavender beads, one pearl
and seven lavender beads, and take a stitch a
quarter of an inch from the beginning and on a
line with it. Now run the needle down through
the last bead strung (see Fig. 56), and string six
more lavender beads, one pearl and seven lavender.
Another stitch is made a quarter of an inch from
the last one, the needle is run down through the
last bead, and it goes on in this way until a row
has been made across the piece of silk. The bag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
is then stitched up the sides and around the bottom
on the wrong side and turned right side out.
Bring the needle attached to the beadwork down
through the six lavender beads and one pearl one,
at the left side of the first half diamond made,
and string six lavender, one pearl and six lavender
beads. Pass the needle through the next pearl bead on
the right in the row above and string another
six lavender, one pearl and six lavender beads
to make another half diamond. So it goes
on around the bag. This row and all the other
ones are only attached to the row above, not to
the silk. The last row of netting should reach a
little below the bottom of the bag. A twisted
fringe is then made as follows: Run the needle
down through the beads on the left side of the
first mesh in the row just finished, through the
pearl bead at the point, and also pass it through the
pearl bead on the back of the bag which lies just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
beneath it. String thirty lavender beads and
pass the needle up through the beads on the right
side of the first mesh and down again through
those on the left side of the second mesh. It
runs through the pearl bead at the point of the
mesh and the one under it at the back of the bag.
String thirty more beads and twist the thread on
which they are strung once around the right side
of the loop just made. The next loop is made in
the same way&mdash;passing the needle up through the
beads in the right side of the second mesh, down
through those in the left side of the third one,
and through the pearl bead at the point of the
mesh at the front and the one below it at the
back. Thirty more beads are then strung. When
you have made this fringe all across the bottom
of the bag, fasten the end of the silk by sewing it
two or three times through the bottom of the
bag. Finish the top of the bag with drawing
strings as follows: Turn in a hem three-quarters
of an inch wide at the top of the bag and baste
it. Hem it around neatly with the lavender sewing
silk and make a casing for the drawing strings
to run through, by putting a row of backstitching
a little over a quarter of an inch above the bottom
of the hem. There should be two little holes made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
on each side of the bag on the outside of the hem
between the stitched seam and the bottom of the
hem. They are put there so that the ribbon
drawing strings can run into the casing. You
can make them with an ivory or metal piercer
called a stiletto, or any other tool that has a sharp
round point. The neatest way to finish these
holes is to sew the edges over and over with a
needleful of sewing silk. Half a yard of narrow
ribbon should be allowed for each drawing string.
Thread it in a bodkin, or ribbon needle, which is
run into one of the holes at the side of the bag,
through the casing at the lower part of the hem,
all around the bag and out of the hole beside the
one where it went in. Now tie the ends of this
drawing string together, thread the other one
through the bodkin and run it into a hole on the
opposite side of the bag, through the casing all
around the bag and out of the little hole beside
the one where it went in. The ends of this piece
are also tied, and then the bag is done.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>CLAY WORKING</small></h2>

<p>Have you ever noticed how, when it rains,
one road will dry at once, and on another your
footprints will hold the water like a cup for hours?
Do you know the reason for it? The first road is
sandy, and so the water filters through the coarse
particles and soon disappears. The other is mostly
of clay, which is close and fine, and after your
foot made that little hollow it was doubtless half
baked by the sun so that it became like natural
pottery. You probably know all this, and have
felt with your own fingers the difference between
the sand, in which you have built forts and dug
with your shovel in the summer and played with
on the kindergarten sand table in winter, and the
soft, smooth clay that you have formed into bird's
nests, eggs and other things in kindergarten.</p>

<p>Years and years ago, before our great-great-great-grandfathers
were even thought of, some
man noticed the same thing that you do&mdash;that one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
part of the earth held water for hours, while it
disappeared so quickly from other parts&mdash;and it
set him thinking. Why not make a bowl in which
he could carry water when he was travelling or
hunting in dry places? This is the way, some
wise men think, the making of pottery began.
Cups and small vessels could easily be moulded
from small lumps of clay, but large pieces&mdash;great
bowls and jars&mdash;it was soon found would have to
be formed in a mould. Shallow baskets, pieces
of gourd or fruit rind, were the moulds in which
these large pots were started.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_132.png" width="450" height="270" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 57</span></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>In beginning the bottom, either a small piece of
clay was patted flat into a form like a cookie and
fitted into the bottom of the mould, or else a strip
of clay was coiled round and round into a mat
shape, working the coils together with the fingers.
The sides were almost always built up with coils
of clay, then, with the fingers and some rude
tools&mdash;smooth stones, bits of shell or pieces of
gourd&mdash;they were smoothed and polished. Soon
the potters began to decorate their vessels with
patterns cut or pressed into the damp clay and
even painted them with coloured clay, ground fine
and mixed with a liquid. The clay objects you
enjoyed making in kindergarten were not very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
strong. A bowl or cup that is moulded from such
clay will not hold water for very long either. It
will soon soften and fall to pieces. That is what
happened to the first clay bowls and cups.</p>

<p>If clay is baked in the sun it becomes a little
harder and more useful&mdash;but not much&mdash;so the
first clay workers found that they must bake their
clay pots more thoroughly if they were to be really
strong. Some of the old potters&mdash;like the Catawba
Indians&mdash;baked their vessels before the fire, and
as the clay they used was very good they found it
made them hard enough. In other tribes the
potters made a bed of bark, set fire to it and
baked the pot until when it came out it was red
hot. At first the clay workers used the clay just
as they found it, but when they began to make
large pots and cauldrons to cook in they found
that powdered shell or sand mixed with the clay
made them stronger and less liable to crack in
baking.</p>

<p>The cooking vessels had almost always rounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
bottoms, because in those days the floors of houses
were of sand or soft earth into which the rounded
bottoms would set and hold the pots upright.
These pots were set directly over the fire and kept
in position by stones or sticks of wood. Some
that had handles or flaring rims could be hung
over the fire by cords or vines.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_133.png" width="500" height="318" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 58</span></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The Indians moulded all sorts of things out of
clay besides these utensils. Drums were made
by stretching buckskin over the tops of earthen
pots. Then there were whistles and rattles,
trowels, modelling tools, figures of men and animals,
and many toys like those shown in Figs. 57, 58
and 59. Beads were also made of clay, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
were tobacco pipes in many shapes. One would
have the face of a man on the bowl, another a
goat with open mouth, or a bird with its neck
outstretched and bill parted, and on another the
bowl would be formed by a natural-looking snake
coiled up for a spring.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 59</span></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>In time men learned more about clays and how
to mix and form and bake them, until now, as
you know, pottery that is beautiful and serviceable
is made all over the world, and in great factories
china and porcelain made of the finest clays are
moulded, decorated and fired for our use. It will
be interesting to you sometime to see one of the
factories where such ware is made, but although
it is so fine and smooth and perfect and so useful
to us, I doubt if the workmen who make it have
half the pleasure in their task that the first potters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
had in moulding their rough cooking utensils and
clay pipes. So I am glad to think that although
you may never be able to make china, you can
work in clay as the Indians used to do, for that
you will enjoy far more.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>Of course you would like to make something
that you can use, something that will not
crumble and break like the things you modelled
in kindergarten. To do this you will need to get
a clay which can be baked&mdash;or fired, as potters
express it&mdash;and you must have a clay that is so
mixed or arranged as to bake well in the kiln (or
pottery oven) to which you are going to send it.
If you live near a pottery where flower pots or
gray stoneware are made you can probably arrange
to buy your clay there, and after your
pottery is finished have it baked at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
place. The clay that is used at a stoneware
pottery is arranged so as to fire at a much
greater heat than the flower-pot clay, and so the
ware is stronger, but the flower-pot ware will
be strong enough for the things you will make.
Although this clay is gray before it is baked, it
comes from the kiln a beautiful Indian red.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_136.png" width="500" height="307" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 62</span></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>You will not need many tools beside your own
fingers and thumbs. One boxwood modelling
tool the shape shown in Fig. 60, and another with
more flattened and rounded ends (see Fig. 61)
will be enough to begin with. These you can buy
at a kindergarten-supply store. Later you may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
need the sheet-steel tools shown in Figs. 62 and
63. Dealers in hardware sell the sheet steel, and
these tools can easily be cut from it&mdash;doubtless
the dealer will do it for you.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_137.png" width="500" height="185" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 63</span></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Buy fifteen or twenty pounds of clay at a time,
ready mixed if possible. If it comes to you in
the dry state&mdash;in rock-like pieces&mdash;you must first
pound it to a powder. This you can do out of
doors by spreading the lumps of clay on a paper
laid on flat stone and pounding them with a
smaller stone, or, if it must be done in the house,
spread the clay on a strong bench or table and
pound it with an old flatiron. It is now ready for
soaking. Put a little water in an earthen crock
and add the powdered clay to it, mixing it with
your hand and adding clay until it is the right
consistency to mould. If you find you have too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
much water, pour off some after the clay is well
mixed, and if it is still too moist, spread it on a
board in the air until it has dried out sufficiently.</p>

<p>Keep the clay in an earthen crock with a cover.
Pour a little water into it first, just enough to
moisten the bottom of the crock, and then put in
the clay. When it is to be left over night or a
longer time, make deep holes in the clay with your
thumb and pour water into them. Lay a damp
cloth over it and cover with the earthen top. If
at any time it dries out so that it cannot be easily
moulded, let it dry entirely, pound it to powder
again and mix as already described.</p>

<p>If you live in the country the place to work with
clay will be in an outbuilding, a woodshed, barn
or workshop where there is a good strong table or
bench. The best place for a city child to work
is a playroom where there is a wooden floor, an
old table and nothing valuable to be harmed with
clay or water; or a light, dry cellar. A girl
should wear a long-sleeved apron and a boy
a pair of overalls. In such a workshop and
costume you need not give a thought to clothes
or carpets.</p>

<p>Have a pitcher of water and a small bowl for
the "slip"&mdash;or clay thinned with water until it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
is about as thick as cream&mdash;which is almost as
important as the clay itself.</p>

<p>When you are ready to begin work, take a lump
of clay about as large as a grape fruit; pound and
knead it on the table. Next draw a strong wire
through it, dividing it into halves. Press the
two outer surfaces together and knead out the
air-holes which you will see on the inner surfaces.
Repeat this process several times, and all these
air bubbles will finally be expelled. Suppose you
begin with something simple&mdash;some tiny red building
bricks which will delight your small brother&mdash;perhaps
even you may not feel to old to enjoy
playing with such a "real" toy.</p>

<p>The clay of which these bricks are made should
be well kneaded, and it should also have a great
deal of what potters call "grog" mixed through
it. "Grog" is baked clay pounded into small
pieces&mdash;an old flower pot will do if you are using<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
flower-pot clay. Mixed with the unbaked clay it
tempers it, that is, it makes it less likely to shrink
and crack in baking.</p>

<p>Cover a level board with a piece of wet white
cheesecloth and tack it securely upon it. Mould
the lump of clay into a square, by hand, lay it
on the board and pound it with the thick part of
your hand into an irregular square cake, then roll
it with a rolling pin till it is about three-eighths of
an inch thick. Have ready another board the
same size and covered with wet cheesecloth, lay
it on top of the clay sheet and reverse it so that
the clay shall be transferred to this second board.
Roll it again till quite smooth and set it away
overnight. The next day take a foot rule and a
sharp pencil and mark the clay sheet into bricks,
two inches long by an inch wide. Cut them out
with a strong, sharp knife, but do not lift them
until they are thoroughly dry, which will be in
three or four days. They should then be carefully
packed and sent to the pottery to be fired.</p>

</div>

<p>The Mexicans mould tiny whistles of clay,
which are as simple as possible to make and very
fascinating to own. If you would like to make
some for yourself and
your friends this is the
way to do it: Mould
a small piece of clay
into a cup shape about
an inch across and
three-eighths of an
inch high. Put it in
the air to dry for ten
minutes. Now roll a piece of clay, about the
same size, on the table with the palms of both
hands (near the base of the thumb), lightly, yet
so as to make the clay roll entirely around with
each push. If the roll flattens from too hard pressure,
pat it till it is round again and roll it until
it is of even thickness&mdash;about quarter of an inch
in diameter. It is then flattened evenly by patting
it with the fingers, one end is cut into a long point
and the coil is started on edge with the narrow
side up on the top of the cup of clay, whose rim
must first be wet with slip. Bend the upper edge
of the roll of clay in quite a little, to follow the
shape shown in Fig. 64. Hold the long end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the clay strip with the left hand, while, with the
thumb and middle finger of the right hand held
on each side of the coil to support it, the forefinger
presses it down firmly on the top of the little cup.
When the coil has gone all the way around cut
the end into a flat point, which will fit evenly in
with the one at the beginning, and press the edges
together with the flat part of the nail of your forefinger.
Do this where the edges of the coil come
against the rim of the
cup. Make quick and
firm yet short strokes
of the nail up and down,
inside the cup and out.
Then let it dry for a
short time, about ten or
fifteen minutes. Roll
another coil in the
same way and attach
it, after brushing the
top edge of the clay
cup with slip, bending
the top edge of the coil
in very decidedly so as
to leave only a small opening at the top. The third
coil is made in the same way, but put on so as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
make the sides go straight up like the neck of a bottle
or vase. One more straight coil completes the
neck, and a piece of clay is then put across the
top, closing it. After the whistle has dried for
an hour or more a triangular hole is cut with a
knife in the lower part (see Fig. 65), and a slit in
the top. A hole is also made in the bottom. It
should then be thoroughly dried for several days
before sending it to be fired. Not every one of
these whistles makes a good clear sound, but they
are so easy to mould that you will not mind one
or two unsuccessful attempts when you finally
make one that blows clear and shrill.</p>

<p>The Indians used to make clay rattles like the
one shown in Fig. 66. It is formed like the whistle
except that the cup-shaped piece which is made in
starting should be an inch and three-quarters

<p>Roll the strips of clay as already described and
brush the edge of the cup-shaped piece with slip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>

about three inches long. Before closing the end
of it drop in four or five clay pellets, about the
size of small peas, which have been well dried in
the sun. Then seal it with a piece of clay, let it
dry for several days and send it to the pottery to

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the best ways to attract the birds is to
have a drinking dish, wide and generous, always
ready for them on the lawn. This is of course
taking for granted that you live at least a part of
the year in the country. Isn't it delightful to
think that you can make such a dish with your
own hands? It is a little more difficult than the
other things you have made, but what of that&mdash;it
will be worth the trouble if you can give a lawn
party to the birds every day! As this is to be
quite a large dish, you will need to have a mould
to form it in, or at least to support the sides in
starting. Choose some low, wide bowl or dish,
one about two inches high and ten inches across
the top. Have ready some powdered flint tied
up in a piece of cotton cloth&mdash;you can buy it of
dealers in potters' supplies or possibly at the
pottery where your clay work is fired. This is to
dust over the inside of the mould to prevent the
clay from sticking to it. Take a lump of clay,
about two and a half pounds, knead and pound
it until all the air bubbles are worked out. A
small piece of the clay is then patted out with the
hands on a table or board and rolled smooth with
a rolling pin until it is three-eighths of an inch
thick and about two inches wider than the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of the bowl you have chosen. Lay it in the bottom
of the mould, which has first been dusted with
ground flint. Press the clay lightly but carefully
against the bottom and sides, making sure that it
fits close against them. Then cut the top edge
even with one of the wooden modelling tools.
With the same tool cut crisscross strokes in this
upper edge and wet it with slip, to prepare it for
the first coil of clay, which is made and attached
like those used in forming the whistle. These
coils should, however, be larger&mdash;about an inch
wide and long enough to go all around the bowl
once. Join every coil in the same way, taking
care to press each one against the sides of the
mould as well as upon the coil beneath, and to
smooth the inside of the bowl with your fingers
and the modelling tools. After attaching a coil,
let the bowl dry for ten or fifteen minutes&mdash;in
the air, unless it is a cold day. Be careful never
to let your clay work freeze or it will be spoiled.
When the bowl is about two inches and a half
high set it away overnight to dry. In the morning
it will have shrunk so that it will slip easily out
of the mould. Turn it bottom up on a table and
wet the cracks between the coils with slip, then
fill them in carefully with clay of the same stiffness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
as that of which the bowl is made. Never put
water or wet clay on a piece of clay work that is
almost dry, or it will crack. After it has been set
away for a few hours to harden, make it smooth
and even as follows: First take the oval tool of
sheet steel with rough edges, hold it in your right
hand, not straight but bent to fit the curves of
the outside of the bowl; with it scrape the large
humps away from the sides of the bowl, making
quick, light and short strokes in every direction&mdash;up,
down, across and diagonally. When the largest
humps have been removed, go over the bowl in
the same way with the smooth-edged oval tool.
Then take a damp sponge, one from which the
water has all been squeezed, and pass it lightly
over the bowl, smoothing it with the fingers.
Make it as even and perfect as you can.</p>

<p>Next the bottom is to be finished. Draw with
a pencil a circle on the bottom of the bowl, about
an inch in from the edge all around, and scrape,
with the sharpest wooden tool, a layer of clay out
of the bottom within the circle, so that the outside
ring shall form a ridge about one-sixteenth of an
inch above it. Now cut the top edge of the bowl
as even as you can by eye, using a knife. Then
make it perfectly even in this way: Pour a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
water on the ground-glass slab, hold the bowl
bottom up and move it firmly yet quickly round
and round on the wet surface and then quickly
slide it off at the edge of the slab, before it has a
chance to cling to the glass. If the bowl seems
too heavy for you to hold securely in moving it
about so quickly, it will be wise to let an older
person do this for you. Then there will be nothing
more to do but let it dry for a few days and send
it to the pottery to be fired.</p>

<small>INDOOR GARDENING</small></h2>

<p class="p3"><em>A Rainy Day in October</em></p>

<p>All summer long the out-of-door gardens kept
us busy, planting, weeding and watering. When
we had had a week or two of sunshiny weather
we began to wish a cloud would sail over the blue
sky and bring the rain our thirsty flowers needed.
We could see the reason for rainy days in summer-time.
Now, however, it is different; a rainy day
in autumn is so cold and disagreeable. It settles
down to work in a business-like way&mdash;not like a
summer shower, which has, all through, a hint of
the sun behind the clouds. No, an autumn rain
is chilly and gray and lasting, and the best way to
forget it is to find something interesting to do
indoors.</p>

<p>Suppose we plan an indoor garden. There are
the plants that were brought in from the garden
the other day&mdash;geraniums, heliotropes, lobelias<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and begonias&mdash;all need our care and attention.
A boy with a taste for woodworking can make a
shelf and put up brackets in a window where the
sun will reach them. Even a plant table may
not prove too difficult for him.</p>

<p>There is one particularly interesting thing that
both boys and girls can do, and that is to plan
Christmas gifts of budded or blossoming plants
for their family and friends. How is it to be
done? Why, by planting bulbs in October. You
have seen bulbs, of course, at the florists; they
are mostly dingy brown or yellow and look like
onions. If anyone in the family had a garden
last summer there will be sure to be catalogues
of seeds and bulbs in the house, and you can begin
by making a list of the bulbs you wish to send for.
Such a number as you have to choose from&mdash;tulips,
crocuses, lilies, hyacinths, narcissus, daffodils, and
plenty more. They are not costly either. Hyacinths
can be bought for from six to fifteen cents
each; these are the ordinary ones. Roman hyacinths,
which have beautiful white flowers, cost
only four or five cents. Chinese lily bulbs are
more expensive; one can be bought for ten cents
or three for twenty-five cents, but they are large
and the blossoms are so fragrant and beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
that they are well worth it. These are grown
among pebbles in a dish of water. They will
look well in a glass dish or in a shallow pottery
bowl&mdash;such as you can buy for ten or fifteen cents
at a Japanese store. For hyacinths, tall, slender
glasses are to be had at the florist's for fifteen
cents. They come in several colours, but the
dark green is best&mdash;and that reminds me that there
is a case you can make of rattan and raffia around
one of these glasses to enable you to hang it beside
a window. This you can do some other rainy
day.</p>

<p>The Chinese lily bulbs are put into a dishful
of tepid water which has a few small pieces of
charcoal in it. A number of small stones are
fitted around the bulbs to keep them upright and
steady, and then they are put near a window
where the sun comes. Hyacinths may be grown
in the glasses or in flower pots, just as one chooses.
A mixture of good soil from the garden and sand
is best if they are to be grown in pots. Be careful
in taking the garden soil to sift it through your
fingers, making sure that no worms are lurking
in it, to trouble the bulbs later on. Put stones
for drainage and some pieces of charcoal at the
bottom of each pot. The bulb is planted so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
about one-third of it is left above the earth. If
it is to be grown in water, use rain water and fill
the glass so that the base of the bulb will just
touch it. However they are planted, in pots or
in glasses, they should be left in a dark, cool place
like an airy cellar, until they are rooted. This will
take about two weeks for those in glasses and six
for the potted hyacinths. If it is possible, bury
the pots in the open ground about six inches deep,
or cover them with soil, for about five weeks.
They can then be put into the window garden.
Consult the bulb catalogues for suggestions as to
the care of your plants.</p>

<h4><em>Basket Case for a Hyacinth Glass</em></h4>

</table></div>

<p>After you have bought your hyacinth glasses,
and before the bulbs are put into them, you may
like to make for each a simple case of basket work
by which it can be hung against the window frame.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<p>It is made of rattan rings bound together with
raffia of some colour that will look well with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
hyacinth blossoms. A dark green glass with a
covering of black and the natural-coloured rattan
bound with copper-coloured raffia is a good combination,
if the hyacinth is to be white.</p>

<p>Make two rings of black rattan like those
described in the directions for making a sponge
bag (see Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">IV</a>). One should be large enough
to slip over the glass, down to about half an inch
from the bottom of it, the other to three inches
from the bottom. This second ring must be made
on the glass, as the flaring top will not allow so
small a ring to slip over it. This will not be
difficult to do. Tie the rattan around the glass
just below where you wish it to be placed (about
two and three-quarters inches from the bottom),
then slip it up where the glass is narrower and
twist the ends around this foundation ring twice,
as shown in Fig. 22. This makes a ring of three
circuits, the foundation ring counting as one.
Make four rings of the natural-coloured rattan,
each measuring two inches and a quarter in diameter
on the inside. These are made with two
circuits; that is, after tying the foundation ring
the ends are twisted all the way around it once,
instead of twice as the black ones were, and are
cut just so that they will lap. Bind these four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
rings together in a hollow square with bindings
five-eighths of an inch long of raffia in buttonhole
stitch (see Fig. 67). Fasten the ends of the
rings by making the
binding come over
them. Slip this square
over the top of the
glass and down between
the two black
rattan rings. Here
each of the four light
rings is bound with
raffia in buttonhole
stitch to the black
ring above it, as well as to the one below. To make
a loop to hang it by, tie a ring of black rattan around
the neck of the glass, twist its ends twice around it,
and then without cutting the ends tie them into
another ring an inch and a quarter in diameter, inside
measurement, which stands out from the glass
and forms a loop. This ring is made with two
circuits.</p>

<h4><em>Growing Plants in Fibre</em></h4>

<p>Later on, in November and December, there
may come days when you are kept indoors, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
then perhaps you will like to do some more gardening
with bulbs. Shall we begin with the spring
bulbs&mdash;tulips, crocuses and daffodils? It is wonderful,
isn't it, to think of being able to plant
them when out of doors the earth is covered thick
with snow? This is how it is done: Buy from
a florist or seedsman a fibre mixture which they
sell for this purpose. Take a large tub or pail
and put some fibre into it, add plenty of water
and stir the fibre thoroughly with a stick. Let
it remain in the water for two days, stirring it
from time to time so that it shall get water soaked.
It will then be ready for use. If you plan to give
the plants away when they are in bud they should
be started in jars or bowls that can be included
in the gift. Japanese or Spanish pottery bowls
can be bought for from ten to twenty-five cents
each, and one of these with a daffodil or narcissus
growing in it will make a delightful birthday gift
for someone you love. If you are not planning
to give them away, of course you will be able to
collect about the house enough bowls and jars of
china and pottery to hold them. Put a few pieces
of charcoal at the bottom of each dish&mdash;these are
to keep the water pure and the fibre wet. Put
into each bowl some of the wetted fibre until it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
is about two or three inches deep, depending on
the depth of the bowl. Place the bulbs on the
fibre so that they just touch and fill all in with
the wet fibre. Put more fibre over them and
press it gently down and around them&mdash;not too
hard. Fill the dish in until it is nearly solid.
Now put the bowls away in a cellar or any dark
but airy room where they will not get frostbitten
and watch them day by day to see that the fibre
does not get dry; it must be kept moist but not
soaking wet. Be especially careful that the bulbs
do not get dry. When they are all rooted and
have grown perhaps an inch, bring the bulbs into
a lighter room and let them have plenty of air.
Put them on the window sill or even in the garden
in the middle of the day, if it is not too cold, and
as they begin to show some buds water regularly
and often.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h4><em>Planting Indoors in February</em></h4>

<p>As early as February you can begin to plan your
out-of-door flower garden and start some seeds
indoors. Tuberous begonias, Canterbury bells,
verbenas, single dahlias, scarlet sage or salvia,
tufted pansies and cosmos can all be started now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
First of all you will need some flats or low wooden
boxes&mdash;they should be about three inches deep
and not too large to handle. If it is possible to
get such shallow boxes at your grocer's so much
the better, otherwise you can have a soap box or
two sawed down to the required height. If they
have no cracks or holes for
drainage, bore some and partly
cover them with pieces of an
old flower pot, rounded side
up. Put pebbles or other
rough material in the bottom
of the box. Now you are
ready for the soil. Get good,
rich loam from the garden
and sift it into the boxes.
You can then begin planting.
The large seeds should be
planted about half an inch deep, medium sized ones
as deep as four times their own width; the very
small ones are just pressed into the earth, and the
smallest should have a piece of glass placed over
the box so that they will not dry out entirely.
Wet the soil until it is quite moist and press it
with a level board after planting. Set the boxes in
a sunny window, one that faces south or southeast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and keep them moist, but not wet, with a bulb
sprinkler (see Fig. 68).</p>

<h4><em>March Planting</em></h4>

<p>This blustery month of bad weather out of doors
you can have a delightful time with your indoor
garden. The bulbs you started in fibre should
be in bloom by this time, and while you are enjoying
them you can start some flower seeds for your
out-of-door garden.</p>

<p>This is the time to plant what are called annuals&mdash;that
is, plants that live just a year&mdash;like
batchelor's-buttons, sweet peas, nasturtiums, four-o'clocks,
marigolds and zinnias. Use flats or
shallow wooden boxes, like those already described,
to plant in. Choose good garden soil and, before
filling the boxes, heat it in the oven, very hot&mdash;this
will kill the weed seeds. Sow the seeds in
rows an inch and a half apart and three-quarters
of an inch apart in the row. When all the seeds
are up, thin the little plants out so that they will
be an inch and a half apart in the row. Put
them in a sunny window as close to the glass as
possible and keep the shades rolled high. If you
do not give them enough sun they will become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
thin and spindly&mdash;like children who never go out.
Turn the boxes now and then so that all sides will
get the sunlight. You will need to put some
labels into each box, bearing the names of the
seeds that are planted there. The best ones are
made from the covers of old grape baskets. Cut
them into strips, write on each the name of the
seed and the date, and stick it into the earth.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_162.png" width="357" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>A little garden for a little girl</p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Gradually as the weather gets warmer you can
give the little plants more air by opening the
windows, and later by putting them out of doors
in some sheltered but sunny spot. When there is
no longer any danger from frost, the boxes can be
set out of doors day and night, only taking them
in in case of a severe storm.</p>

<p>The seedlings may need to be separated and
transplanted indoors before it is warm enough to
set them in the out-of-door garden. Common
grape baskets do very well for this purpose and
hold about a dozen little plants&mdash;flats may also
be used. Allow as much space between the seedlings
as possible, for if they are too close the roots
will twine about each other and make it very hard
to transplant them later on. When they are
large enough to be transplanted put them into a
basin of lukewarm water and plant them in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
new box one at a time. Do not put them in the
sun for a few days, but keep them shaded until
they have taken root.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h4><i>Starting Gourd Vines in the Indoor Garden</i></h4>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_165.png" width="290" height="350" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 69</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of course you have seen gourds, perhaps not growing, but surely
you know how they look when dried. Hard, smooth-shelled things of a
beautiful golden brown colour, they grow in the strangest shapes. Some
are round or oval with a queer twisted stem (see Fig. 69). They have
many uses&mdash;to hold the stockings open and smooth (so that grandma
can darn them easily), as bird houses, match holders, and even for
drinking cups.</p>

<p>They are the fruit of a vine which would be charming to train on a
trellis or arbour in your out-of-door garden, and then when harvest
time came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span> you would have the interesting gourds to dry
and use as you chose.</p>

<p>If you would like to raise them, sow the seeds
in shallow wooden boxes indoors in March. Plant
them a quarter of an inch deep, and when the
little plants crowd one another and are strong
enough to transplant remove them to larger
boxes and plant them six inches apart. When
planting the vines out of doors in May or June
put plenty of manure about them and give them
ample space. If the vines bear many gourds,
and all small ones, pinch off some and the others
will develop better. Do not pick the gourds until
they are quite ripe; that is, when they begin to
look slightly yellow. They need plenty of hot
sun in order to come to perfection. Leave them
as long as possible on the vines, only being careful
that they are not touched with frost. In the
South they are sometimes left on the vines all
winter.</p>

<p>After picking them, hang them in an airy place
in the house or out of doors. Leave a little of
the vine on each one and they can then be hung
by strings tied to these handles. If you follow
these few rules your gourds should dry smooth
and hard.</p>

<h4><em>How to Start Lavender Indoors</em></h4>

<p>Do you know the smell of lavender&mdash;that sweet,
refreshing perfume that clings to some of grandmother's
treasures of linen and embroidery? One
catches a whiff of it in old gardens sometimes,
and it is always welcome. You can buy the seed
from a florist or seedsman&mdash;<em>Lavandula vera</em> is
what the true English lavender is called, and that
is best. If it cannot be had, <em>Lavandula spica</em> is
next best. It takes time to raise either, but it
will be such an addition to your out-of-door garden
that you will not regret the time spent. About
the first of March the lavender seed should be
sown, in window boxes or flats. Make shallow
drills with your finger, drop the seed in and cover
lightly. Sprinkle them every day with your bulb
sprinkler until they come up. When the little
plants each have four leaves they may be transplanted.
Before starting to transplant them they
should be thoroughly wet. Set them five inches
apart. In the winter protect the plants with
litter&mdash;leaves, straw, etc.&mdash;six inches deep. The
next year, in March, they should be set in rows
three feet apart.</p>

<p>When the plants are in full bloom the sprigs are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
cut, and then dried in a cool, darkened room or
closet. Lay them on paper so as to save all the
blossoms. The lavender flowers may be made
into the daintiest of sachets by filling with them
sheer linen bags or pale lavender silk ones.</p>

<p>The sprigs that are left after the blossoms have
fallen may be used like Chinese incense to sweeten
a room, by lighting the blossom end of a single
piece and letting it burn in a vase or incense holder.</p>

<small>GIFTS AND HOW TO MAKE THEM</small></h2>

<p>It is wonderful what your head and hands can
do when you begin to plan gifts for family and
friends at Christmas, birthdays and the in-between
times when "un-birthday presents"&mdash;as "Alice in
Wonderland" called them&mdash;are so welcome. But
I am sure you know the breathless feeling of having
to make or buy a long list of Christmas presents
with only two weeks or so in which to accomplish it.
Why not keep a gift box or drawer, where you can
pack away the pretty things you take such pleasure
in making on dull days all the year round? There
are ever so many things&mdash;games, toys, baskets and
beadwork&mdash;which you will find in other chapters&mdash;that
will help to fill this gift box, and I am going to
tell you about some others.</p>

<p>There are several things to think of in planning
a gift. It should be something that will be within
your means, something that is worth giving, however
small&mdash;not "trash"; but what is most im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>portant
of all is that it shall really please the one
who receives it. If it can be a lasting pleasure so
much the better.</p>

<p>Suppose you try keeping a notebook; begin it
now, and write down the little things that you hear
the family wish for during the year&mdash;tiny things,
maybe, but just what they want. For instance,
Aunt Helen, who writes, never has enough pencils&mdash;her
nieces and nephews know why. Father is
unable to find an express tag when he wants one,
because he has no case to hang close beside his desk.
Joe says he wishes someone would make him a
chamois cover for his new knife&mdash;it is getting
scratched already; and mamma cannot find that
recipe for potted pigeons that she cut from the
paper Saturday evening. What a number of
entries you will be able to make in your gift book!
See how it reads:</p>

<blockquote><p>Aunt Helen: One dozen pencils.</p>

<p>Father: Leather tag case and tags.</p>

<p>Mother: A blank book with her newspaper recipes pasted in.</p>

<p>Joe: A chamois knife case.</p></blockquote>

<p>And this is just a beginning. When you visit
your friends you will soon see or hear what little
things will please them. Then you can begin col<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>lecting
the materials for your gift box, and when a
rainy day comes what pleasant hours you will
spend.</p>

<p>Let us begin with the</p>

<h4><i>Beaded Knife Case</i></h4>

</div>

<p>One of the simplest and prettiest gifts you can
make is this beaded knife case. If you have made
the Indian costume described in Chapter V. you
will have plenty of scraps of chamois left. Otherwise
you can buy a small chamois skin in the natural
colour, or, if you prefer another colour, skins of
beautiful tints may be bought. Red is very effective
and not as costly as some others. In buying a
skin, choose a colour that you will not tire of, for
you will be able to make so many small things of it
that it will be well to have a colour you will always
like; either red or green or a soft brown that is not
too light will be a good choice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>From a piece of cardboard cut the patterns shown in
Figs. 70 and 71. If the case is for a penknife, the
larger one (Fig. 70) should measure one inch wide by
four and one-eighth inches long, and the other should be
the same width but two and three-quarters inches long.
Cut two pieces of chamois from these patterns, lay the
smaller one against the larger, with the rounded ends of
both together and the edges of the sides fitted evenly,
and baste them so. Now start at the top left-hand edge
of the smaller piece, where it comes against the edge
of the larger one, and sew the edges together with the
stitch shown in Fig. 72. This is how it is done: Thread
a No. 11 needle with sewing silk the colour
of the chamois. Fasten the end by sewing through
and through the edges of the case. String three
beads and make one over-and-over stitch through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
both edges of the case, bringing the needle out at
about one-eighth of an inch from where it started.
Run the needle up through the third bead, string
two more, make another stitch, run the needle up
through the last bead strung, and so on. When
you have gone all the way around the double edge,
continue the stitch across the top of the smaller
piece and around the rounded top of the larger.
Next a loop must be made to fasten the case. Hold
a small pencil at the top of the larger piece of
chamois close to the rounded edge, and, starting
about an eighth of an inch from the centre of this
end, fasten an end of a needleful of sewing silk;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
take a stitch around the pencil and in at one-eighth
of an inch the other side of the centre. Take
six or eight stitches back and forth in this way.
This will make a loop, which should be covered with
buttonhole stitches. Now slip the knife into the
case, turn the flap (the rounded edge of the larger
piece) down and mark the place to sew the large
bead over which the loop is to fit, in order to fasten
it. Sew an E bead the colour of the smaller beads
at this place, bring the loop over it, and the case is
complete.</p>

<p>The Shakers make needle books of fine straw
cloth, that are so dainty and yet simple that they
are well worth copying. Fig. 73 shows the shape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
in which the cover of the book is cut. It may
be made of two pieces of bristol board; one
covered with flowered silk or ribbon, the other
with plain silk that will harmonise with the flowered.
The two are then
basted together and
sewed over and over.
Two pieces of flannel
are cut the same shape,
but about half an inch
smaller all the way
around. These are laid inside the cover, which
is then bent exactly at its centre so that both
ends will come evenly together. A hole is punched
through both sides of the cover and the flannel at
about half an inch in from the edge and quarter of
an inch from the doubled middle of the cover.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Another hole is made on the other side of it and a narrow
ribbon threaded in a bodkin, or ribbon needle,
is brought in through one hole, across the back and
out through the other. The ends are then tied
in a pretty bow (see Fig. 74), which finishes it.</p>

<p>Did you know that the white sweet clover that
grows in long spike-shaped sprays on low bushes
along the wayside is even more fragrant when it is
dried? Gather some this summer, and spread it
where it will dry in the sun, turning it often. Strip
the blossoms from the stems, and when a rainy day
comes you can make with them some gifts that will
be welcome wherever they go. Keep the flowers
in a covered box till you are ready to use them,
then make linen, or even pretty white cotton, bags
about ten inches long by six wide. Fill them with
the dried clover, sew up the ends securely, and they
will be ready to send to grandmothers, aunts and
cousins, to make their linen closets fragrant. A
little pillow of white cotton filled with these flowers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
with a pretty outer case of fine linen, makes a delightful
gift for an invalid friend.</p>

<p>One of your friends who wears eyeglasses was
told by a wise person that the best thing with which
to clear her glasses was&mdash;what do you think? Not
a handkerchief or a piece of chamois, but soft tissue
paper. "That is simple enough, I'm sure," said
she; but it wasn't, for whenever she wanted a piece
of tissue paper it didn't happen to be near, so she
used a handkerchief or chamois most of the time.
She found the tissue paper was much better, however,
and wondered why children who don't know
what to give to friends who wear eyeglasses or
spectacles, don't give them a pad of tissue paper to
hang by the dressing table or some such convenient
place. True, its use would have to be explained,
for not many people know that tissue paper is such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
a good cleaner of glasses; but when they have tried it
they will be really grateful for the helpful little gift.</p>

<p>Cut soft white tissue paper in sheets four inches
wide by six and one-half long, and make a cover of
green or brown leather the same size. Punch two
holes at the top of the cover, each about half an
inch down from the top and one inch in from the
side. Lay the cover on the pile of tissue paper
sheets and run an awl or punch through the holes
in the cover, making holes in the same places
through the tissue paper. Cut a strip of leather
about one-quarter of an inch wide and fifteen
inches long, thread it in a bodkin, run it through
the hole on the right of the cover, through the
sheets of tissue paper and out of the hole on the
left of the cover. Here it is tied in a bow, leaving
a long loop at the back to hang it by. A large bead
of a colour that will look well with the leather may
be strung on each end of the bow and a knot tied to
keep it from falling off. If you choose, the edges
of the cover may be worked with the bead stitch
shown in Fig. 54.</p>

<p>One of the most delightful of gifts can be planned
by a little girl of boy for a friend who is learning to
knit. This is the wonder ball. It is one of the
many good ideas that come to us from Germany&mdash;the
land of knitting.</p>

<p>Buy a hank of worsted of some pretty colour
and a number of tiny gifts&mdash;a thimble, a wee package
of chocolate, the smallest of baskets and any
other little things you can think of. Start winding
the worsted around the very choicest gift&mdash;so that it
shall be at the centre&mdash;then by degrees, as you
wind, lay the other gifts on the ball and cover them
with the worsted. Your little friend should be
told to knit till all the presents are found.</p>

<p>The friend who travels will be glad to have a case in
which to keep her pins. It is very simple to make.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>Cut from any pretty piece of silk or velvet a strip
five inches wide by eight long, or a piece of five-inch
flowered ribbon the same length will do even better.
Another strip of thin silk&mdash;white or some colour
that will look well with the first piece&mdash;should be
cut the same size, if the flowered piece is of silk;
if it is of ribbon, cut the lining silk half an inch
wider. A piece of the cotton wadding that comes
in sheets is cut half an inch smaller in length and
width than the others. Half a yard of narrow
ribbon to match the silk, and a spool of sewing silk
will also be needed, and if you like you can give a
still more festive touch to the case by filling it with
fancy pins, those with pearl or gun-metal heads.</p>

<p>First baste the strip of cotton wadding on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
lining silk through the centre, then turn quarter of
an inch of the edge of the silk up over the wadding
and baste it securely around all four sides. Now
baste the flowered silk cover against the other side
of the wadding, turning in all rough edges, and
making sure that the edges of the lining and cover
are quite even, one above the other. Sew them
together over and over, as neatly as possible, with
the coloured sewing silk, and stitch the ribbon at
its centre to the middle of one end of the case to
form strings (see Fig. 75). After it is filled with
the pretty pins and rolled up, bring the ribbons
around it and tie them in a dainty little bow.</p>

<p>A case that is made in very much the same way
as the one for pins is used for holding pieces of tape
of various widths. It is something that almost any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
aunt would be delighted to have for her work
basket.</p>

</div>

<p>Packages of what is called India tape are sold
at many of the dry goods shops for five or ten
cents. They contain bunches of tape of different
widths, a yard or two in each bunch. Pieces
of pretty cotton, one figured or flowered, the other
plain, will do quite as well as silk to make the case.
Then you will need a simple metal or bone bodkin
and three-quarters of a yard of narrow ribbon or
silk braid. That is all except a spool of cotton,
needle and scissors.</p>

<p>Cut a piece of plain-coloured cotton eight inches
long by four and a half wide, and lay the bunches of
tape all along it, about an inch apart. Now lay a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
piece of half-inch wide ribbon or silk braid along
above the bunches of tape and exactly at the
middle of the strip of cotton, as shown in Fig. 76.
Pin the ribbon to the cotton lining at each side of
every piece of tape, making a loop that is large
enough for each bunch to slip through without pulling
the cotton lining. A little loop should also be
made just large enough to hold the bodkin. Now take
out the bunches of tape and stitch the ribbon to the
lining where it is pinned. Cut a piece of flowered
cotton the same size as the lining, and, turning in
the edges of both pieces for a quarter of an inch all
the way round, lay them together with the raw
edges in and baste them evenly one above the
other. Next sew them together over and over all
around. Stitch the middle of a piece of ribbon
sixteen inches long to the middle of the right end
of the case, slip the bunches of tape and the bodkin
through their loops, roll the case and tie the ribbon
strings around it. It will then be ready to pop
into your gift box.</p>

</div>

<p>A lamp mat will be a welcome gift to mamma or
even to your big brother for his room at college.
The simplest one to make is of braided raffia. Take
six pieces of raffia and tie them together at one end.
Fasten this end to a nail or chair back, at a convenient
height. If the raffia is dampened a little
it will work more smoothly. Now braid it into a
three-stranded plait, using two pieces for each
strand. When a new piece is needed lay it above
the end of the old one and continue. The ends are
cut close after the braid is finished. You will need
a great deal of this braided raffia&mdash;about ten yards
of the natural colour and two or three of the
coloured&mdash;but do a little at a time and you will
find it pleasant work. When you have enough
prepared, thread a No. 19 tapestry needle with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
split strand of raffia and bind the end of it tightly
around the end of the natural-coloured braid,
taking a stitch or two through it to secure the
binding. Now cut off the knot (which tied all six
pieces together in starting) close to the binding and
coil the braid into a tiny round centre. Run the
needle through this centre back and forth, then
start coiling the second row, bringing the long end
of the braid around with its edge under the outer
edge of the centre. The needle is run in slanting
from right to left (see Fig. 77), then out from right
to left, so that the stitches form a V within the coil.
The whole mat is coiled and sewed in this way,
except that when the last row of natural-coloured
braid is stitched on, the end is bound as it was at
the beginning and brought gradually in under the
mat, where it is sewed securely. Be sure that you
have finished a row before you end it off. This you
can tell by counting the rows, from the centre out,
on all sides of the mat. An end of the coloured
braid (which is to form the border of the mat) is
also bound with a split strand of coloured raffia
and sewed against the under side of the mat. It
is then sewed around like the rest of the mat,
except that in the first row you will have to take
great care to run the stitches through the natural-coloured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
braid so that they will not show. Be sure
to finish the border at the part of the mat where it
was started.</p>

<p>A soft, thick lamp mat that is beautiful to look

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_189.png" width="500" height="223" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 78</span></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Buy twelve or fourteen yards of cotton clothesline.
It is white and smooth, and twisted like the
fibre clothesline. Or there is a soft cotton window
cord that is even better, because it is smoother.
Thread a No. 19 tapestry needle with a strand of
raffia, putting the thick, or root, end through the
needle. Lay the other end of the raffia on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
rope, with its tip turning toward the long end.
Starting at the very end of the rope, wind the long
end of raffia around it (and its own short end)
for an inch or more.
Then coil it into the
smallest ring you possibly
can, bring the
long end of the raffia
around, up through
the centre of the ring
and around again,
taking in two coils&mdash;the
one of which the ring was made and a second
one made by bringing the long end of the rope around
the ring (see Fig. 78). The first and second coils are
covered in this way with a simple over-and-over
stitch, which binds them together, passing around
both and up through the centre. With the third coil
the real stitch begins. It is an Indian one called the
Figure Eight Stitch. The needle passes under the
third coil (that is, the long end of rope which you
are coiling around), around, over it, under the coil
below, around, over it and up again, under and
around the third coil&mdash;drawing the coils close
together. The whole mat is sewed in this way. If
you choose, you can work a design of coloured rings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
as a border or a solid border of the coloured raffia.
Fig. 79 shows how the new pieces of raffia are
added. Cross the old and new ends on the rope,
bring the needle threaded with the new strand
under the lower coil, out in front, over the lower
coil, under and around the upper one, and so on.</p>

<p>How would you like to make a doll's raffia hat, as
a birthday gift for one of your special friends&mdash;one
that will fit her favourite doll? Of course it is to
be a surprise, but you will have plenty of opportunities
to measure the dolly's head. The raffia
comes in so many colours that you will be able to
choose one to match a special gown. When you
are ready to begin, make five yards or more of
braided raffia as described in the directions for the
braided raffia lamp mat, and start the hat in the
same way as the mat was begun, except that an
oval instead of a round centre is formed. When
you have made a large enough top for the crown,
bring the coil of braid around, with its upper edge
a little above the middle of the row just finished,
drawing it quite tight, and in sewing make the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
stitches run like the twists in the braid&mdash;so that
they will show as little as possible. The next row
is sewed in the same way, and the next, until the
crown is the height you wish. In starting the brim
flatten the braid and bring it around more loosely.
Be sure that each row of braid is sewed half way
under the row to which you are stitching it. Make
the whole brim in this way, keeping the braid
always flat and loose so that it shall not pucker.
When it is as large as you wish, you can make the
edge roll slightly by drawing the last two rows quite
tight as you sew them on. Fasten the end of the
braid at the back of the hat by binding it with the
raffia in your needle and stitching it firmly on the
under side of the brim.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Leather Tag Case</span></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>One of the best presents a child can give to his
father, or a man friend, is a leather case full of tags.
Things made of leather are so handsome and
durable that you cannot do better, in buying
material for your gift
box, than to invest in
a skin of heavy leather
in the natural colour,
red or green. Another
useful thing for your
gift work will be a
punch with which to
make round holes in
leather or cardboard.
You will then only
need a pair of scissors,
a pencil and a few beads in order to be equipped not
only to make this tag case but several other charming
gifts. Measure and mark with pencil on the
leather two pieces, one six inches and one-quarter
long by three inches and one-half wide, the other
four and one-half inches long by three and one-half
inches wide, and cut them out carefully. Also
cut a number of strips of leather a quarter of an
inch wide and as long as the skin will allow. On
each corner of the smaller piece of leather mark a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
dot three-sixteenths of an inch in from the edge.
Then make three more dots the same distance from
the edge and about an inch apart on each side, and
two near the bottom, the same distance from the
edge and each other. Now with your punch make
holes through these dots. Lay this piece of leather
on the larger one, with the lower edges and sides
together, and with a pencil mark through the holes
on the piece below. Dots are also made three-sixteenths
of an inch in from the edge at each of the
upper corners of the larger piece of leather, two about
an inch apart at the middle of the top edge, and one
more on either side, half way between the dots at the
upper corners and the upper ones of those already
marked from the smaller piece of leather. All
these dots have holes punched through them. Now
lay the pieces together, the smaller one on top,
with its lower edge and sides fitting exactly with
the bottom and sides of the larger piece. Starting
at the upper right-hand corner of the smaller piece,
bring a bodkin threaded with a long strip of leather
up through the holes in both pieces, then up through
the next hole below in both pieces, lacing them
together all the way around to the other side.
Here the bodkin is slipped off and the end is knotted
with another strip of leather. On this new strip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the bodkin is threaded and brought up through
each hole in succession along the left side, the top
and down the right side of the large piece of leather.
It stops where the lacing began, and the ends are
there tied together. A large bead is slipped on
each of these ends and one on each of the two ends
on the opposite side, and a knot is made at the
tip to keep the bead from falling off. To make
a loop to hang it by, thread the bodkin with a
short strip of leather, run it down through the left
of the two middle holes at the top of the case and
out again through the right one. Cut it the length
you wish the loop to be and thread a bead on each
end, making a knot at the tip to keep the bead on.</p>

<p>A pen wiper is such a usual present that you
may think no one would care for it, but look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
around and you will surely find a big brother or
sister, or perhaps a friend, who hasn't one. And
this is such an interesting pen wiper to make. It
is very simple, just two round pieces of leather and
three of chamois. The top piece of leather has the
design shown in Fig. 80 worked on it in beads of a
colour that will look well with the leather you have
chosen. Black and crystal beads will harmonise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
with red leather or dark-green crystal and opaque
white. If the leather is not so bright a colour, the
beads may be more gay. Work the design with
the stitch described in the directions for making an
Indian beaded shirt in Chapter V., bringing the
strings of beads farther apart at the outer edge of
the circle than on the inside. When the beadwork
is done, put the pieces of leather together with the
chamois ones between, mark two dots a quarter of
an inch apart at the centre of the top, punch holes
through the dots and then through the other pieces
of chamois and leather. A bodkin threaded with a
strip of leather is then run down through one hole,
up through the other, and the ends are knotted
together and cut quite short.</p>

<h4><em>Baby's Worsted Ball</em></h4>

</table></div>

<p>We have not made any plans, as yet, for a gift for
the baby. Suppose we make him a great, fluffy
worsted ball. Among your mother's odds and ends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
of worsted you will find plenty of gay colours that
will be exactly what you want. Then you will
need some thin cardboard, or bristol board. On
this mark two circles, five inches in diameter, and
at the centre of each of these, two smaller circles an
inch and a quarter in diameter. Cut out the two
large circles and the small holes within them. You
will then have two circular pieces of cardboard with
a round hole in the centre of each, making it look
like a cookie. Take a strong but slender piece of
string about a foot long and lay it around the hole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
in the centre of one of the pieces of cardboard, with
the ends coming together below the outer edge
(see Fig. 81). Lay the other piece of cardboard
directly over the first one and hold them firmly
together (see Fig. 82) while with a needle threaded
with worsted you sew around and around the
cardboard rings, bringing the needle each time
through the hole in the centre and around the outer
edge of both rings. When a needleful of worsted
is finished leave the end hanging and start another.
Keep on until the hole in the middle is quite filled
up and the whole thing looks like a puffy cushion.
Now take a sharp pair of scissors and cut the layers
of worsted at the outer edge of the pasteboard rings
all the way around. Do this carefully but quickly,
and be sure not to cut the two ends of string, for
now is the time to use them. They are tied
together just as tightly as possible, and as close to
the centre. The cardboard rings are then slipped
out, leaving a soft, fluffy ball of many colours.
Clip off the uneven ends of worsted here and there,
and the ball will be complete.</p>

<p>It sometimes seems, on a rainy day, as if there
was nothing to do because you have not the materials
that are needed for certain occupations&mdash;but
there is always paper. You
may not, of course, have all
the things that are used in making
tissue-paper flowers, unless you have
been so thrifty as to buy them,
looking forward to just such a
time as this. But if you cannot
make the flowers at once, you can
decide which ones you wish to do
and plan a list of the materials
you will need. Then there are
numbers of things that you can
fashion from watercolour paper,
or even heavy note paper and cardboard; so
let us get out pencil and paper, paste and
scissors, and begin.</p>

<p>How would you like to make a game of your very
own with which you and your brothers and sisters or
some of your friends can play? It is
quite simple&mdash;just a great paper daisy
with a slip of paper pasted on the
under side of each petal. Upon each
slip is written a sort of conundrum,
the answer to which is the name of a
plant or flower. If you can get a real
daisy for a model, so much the better.</p>

<p>Fold a large sheet of linen writing
paper diagonally so that you will have
a square eight by eight inches. Bend
it over again diagonally, and then again
and again, so that it will have been
folded four times in all. Now draw the
outline of a daisy petal upon the folded
paper (see Fig. 83), and cut it out
through all the thicknesses. This will give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
you a sixteen-petaled daisy. The centre has
next to be made. Cut from deep-yellow tissue
paper eight circles three inches across, six circles
two inches, and six an inch across. This is
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'aesily'">easily</ins> done by folding the paper into as many
thicknesses as you wish circles of each size,
so that you can cut through them all at once.
Before separating the circles cut the edges into
a fine fringe about three-eighths of an inch
deep. Fold a piece of olive-green tissue paper
in the same way as the white paper for the
petals was folded, but once more, and cut it
like Fig. 84. This is for the calyx. Next cut
some slips of paper just large enough to be
pasted on the underside of the petals and write
on each a number and a conundrum from the
following list:</p>

<ol>
  <li class="first" >A public building in Philadelphia.</li>
  <li> A plant that rhymes with pansy.</li>
  <li> A foolish wild animal.</li>
  <li> A wise man.</li>
  <li> Fit for a king.</li>
  <li> A girl's name.</li>
  <li> A plant for Sundays.</li>
  <li> For thirsty folk.</li>
  <li> Several droves of sheep.</li>
  <li> Part of a pet.</li>
  <li> Two girls' names.</li>
  <li> Something that we know flies, though no one has ever seen it.</li>
  <li> A rosy athlete.</li>
  <li> A necessary article of food and a piece of china.</li>
  <li> A girl's name and a metal.</li>
  <li> An animal and a covering for the hand.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>The following key, or answers to the conundrums,
you will of course keep hidden until after the game
has been played:</p>

<ol>
  <li class="first"> Mint</li>
  <li> Tay</li>
  <li> Dandelion.</li>
  <li> Sage.</li>
  <li> Goldenrod.</li>
  <li> Sumach (Sue Mack).</li>
  <li> Jack-in-the-pulpit.</li>
  <li> Pitcher-plant.</li>
  <li> Phlox (Flocks).</li>
  <li> Cattail.</li>
  <li> Rosemary.</li>
  <li> Thyme.</li>
  <li> Scarlet runner.</li>
  <li> Buttercup.</li>
  <li> Marigold.</li>
  <li> Foxglove.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>When the slips have each been pasted on a petal
the daisy is put together in this way: Take a long,
stout piece of wire, such as is sold for paper-flower
stems; put the yellow circles all together, the larger
ones at the bottom, then the medium ones and the
smallest on top. Bend one end of the wire into a
tiny ring and run the other end down through the
centre of the yellow circles, then through the middle
of the white circle with the petals on its edge,
putting a touch of paste between the centre and
the petals. Now paste a thin layer of cotton batting
to the lower side of the petal-edged piece, at
the centre, and run the wire stem through the
middle of the green calyx, pasting the paper lightly
to the cotton. Wind the stem with olive-green
tissue paper cut in strips two inches wide, and
cut from the same paper some leaves as much as
possible like the little leaves of a daisy plant.
The directions for playing this game are given in
chapter X.</p>

<p>Little country girls are almost always useful,
and though this one is only made of paper she can
be useful too. She will serve as a dinner card or
a penwiper, or even carry courtplaster
to those who need it. If
you do not care for any of these
things you can play with her,
for she makes a charming paper
doll. Fig. 85 shows one side of
the little girl, the other is just
the same. She is made as follows:
Cut from brown paper
the pattern shown in Fig. 86,
making it six and a half inches
high by four and three-eighths
inches broad&mdash;at the widest
point. Take care to mark the dotted lines
exactly where they are in the picture. It will
be better to draw the apron, sunbonnet and little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
shoes on the pattern, for then you can copy directly
from it instead of from the smaller one in the book.
Lay the pattern on a piece of heavy watercolour
paper and draw around it with a sharp-pointed
pencil, marking the dotted lines exactly. Next
the little girl must be cut out. Do this carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
with a pair of small, sharp scissors. Bend the paper
on the dotted lines so that it will look like Fig. 85.
On all the lines except the one down the front A (see Fig. 86) and
the two marked B the paper is bent forward, on these two it turns
back and the flaps on the bottom of the shoes are turned back. Now
for the finishing touches. For these you will need pen and ink and a
box of watercolour paints. The dress, where it peeps out beyond the
white apron, the bands on the sleeves and the dots and edge of the
sunbonnet, should all be painted some pretty colour&mdash;pink, red,
blue, green or yellow&mdash;whatever you choose. The shoes should be
black, and the outlines of the apron and pockets, the gathers of the
sleeves and sunbonnet are all drawn in black ink.</p>

<p>The little girl is now complete unless you wish to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
have her stand by herself, in which case cut a circular
piece of cardboard and glue her upon it by
the flaps on her shoes. If you would like to
make her useful, you can attach two or three
tiny sheets of courtplaster between her skirts
or several leaves of flannel, so that she can
serve as a penwiper.</p>

<p>Another delightful little paper person made on
the plan of the Country Girl is the Santa Claus
shown in Fig. 87. He makes a charming Christmas
card to carry greetings or a gift. The pattern (see
Fig. 88) is made five and one-eighth inches high by
five and a quarter inches wide, of brown paper, in
the same way as the pattern of the country girl.
Santa Claus is also cut from watercolour paper and
bent according to the dotted lines. The colouring
should be red and white, of course, with a green
holly wreath. It would not do to forget the Saint's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
pack, which is cut from the pattern shown in Fig. 89.
It is painted brown, with gaily coloured toys&mdash;dolls,
drums and Noah's arks&mdash;peeping out at the top. Paste it between
the two sides of Santa Claus near his shoulders.</p>

<p>As a companion for the Country Girl you can make, if you like, a
Seashore Boy (see Fig. 90) in just the same way. The pattern given in
Fig. 91 shows where the paper is to be folded. From all the folds the
paper should bend backward except on the lines marked A, from these
it bends forward. The colouring should be mostly blue and white.
The great sun hat will be straw coloured, of course, with a blue band.
His short socks are of white, with brown legs showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>

one with a blue tie. The pail may be painted red.</p>

<p>A boy or girl with deft fingers can make the most
attractive little valentine favour imaginable in a
short time and at very slight expense. It is a
double heart of watercolour paper, painted scarlet
and with a silk puff of the same colour drawn up at
the top, making a bag for bonbons.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 93</span></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The heart is perhaps the most difficult part, but a
child who has learned in kindergarten to weave with
paper will be able to do it without much trouble.
Cut from watercolour paper two pieces in the shape
shown in Fig. 92. The paper should be doubled and
the fold laid against the straight edge at the bottom
of the pattern. The size does not matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
very much, though if the heart is to hold anything the pieces should
measure four inches and a quarter from the doubled edge to the top of
the rounded end and two and five-eighths inches across. Rule with pencil
a light line across each piece at two and five-eighths inches from the
straight end. Five lines are also ruled in the other direction, the
first one seven-sixteenths of an inch from one side of each piece of
paper and the others the same distance apart (see Fig. 92). Cut along
these lines with sharp, strong scissors from the double straight
edge to the ruled line near the top of each piece.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
The lower part of both pieces will thus be cut into
doubled strips. Now take a piece in each hand,
rounded end down, and weave the lower strip of
the piece in your right hand through the strips in
the left-hand piece. As the strips are double, the
weaving must be done rather differently than with
single strips of paper. The strip with which you
are weaving goes around the first strip in the left-hand
piece, through the next one, around the next,
and so on (see Fig. 93). When it comes to
the end it is pushed down a little way and the
next strip on the right is woven above it, only
that this one passes through the strips that
the first one passed around, and around those
that the first one passed through. Weave
one after another until all six of the strips
in the right-hand piece are woven in with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
those on the left&mdash;when it should open to form a
heart-shaped bag, as shown in Fig. 94.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 94</span></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Colour the heart on both sides with vermilion watercolour paint and
it will then be ready for the silk top. Cut from scarlet China silk a
strip five inches wide by half a yard long. Sew the ends together, hem
the top and make a casing for the ribbon drawstring, as described in
the directions for the beaded silk bag in chapter V. The lower edge is
gathered to fit the inside of the top of the heart and pasted into it on
a straight line, running just below the openings, around both
sides of the heart. If the paste is not very
sticky you may need to take a tiny stitch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
here and there with scarlet sewing silk, tacking
the silk top more securely to the heart. It will
then be ready to line with a lace paper doily or
some waxed paper, and fill with bonbons.</p>

<p>There is a funny frog jumping jack that you can
make if you like some cheerless, rainy day. He
brings smiles wherever he goes.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 96</span></p>

</div>

<p>Take a sheet of heavy four-ply bristol board and
draw upon it the pieces shown in Figs. 95, 96, 97
and 98&mdash;the frog's head and body, legs and one arm.
Make them as large as you can. The head and
body together should measure eight inches high
by seven wide, from the right side to the end of the
mandolin on the left. The legs should be about
six and a half inches long and the right arm should
of course be the size of the left, which is drawn on
the same piece as the body. Colour the body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
throat and legs pale yellow with watercolour paint;
the upper part of the head, the arms and the outer
edges of the body and legs are first painted light
green and then marked with irregular spots and
dashes of medium and dark bluish green. A red
ribbon with a Maltese cross of the same colour is
painted around his neck, and the mandolin he holds
is white above and black underneath. The eyes
should be dark green with very large whites, and
the smiling mouth red, of course. The strings of
the mandolin are drawn with pen and ink, as are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the outlines of the whites of the eyes, the hands
and feet. Now Mr. Frog must be put together.
Tie a knot in a piece of fine white string and thread
the other end through
a large worsted needle.
Run the needle through
the frog's body at the
lower right side (where
you see the dot on Fig.
95), leaving the knot in
front, pass it through
the right leg about half
an inch from the top and fasten it with a knot
at the back. The other leg is attached in the
same way, and the right arm is placed in
position and fastened to the body as the legs were.
A knot is then made in a piece of white cord and
the end is brought through the right arm (leaving
the knot in front) about three-quarters of an inch
below where it is fastened to the body, and near the
outer edge of the arm. The end of the string is
brought down at the back of the frog, quite
loosely, to the upper part of the right leg,
where it passes through and is tied to the part
of the string that comes from the arm (see Fig. 99).
It is then brought across to the top of the left leg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
where it is tied. A separate string fifteen inches
long is attached to the centre of the piece, which
passes from one leg to the other (this is the one
that is pulled to make him jump), and a short loop
of string is fastened at the top of his head by which
to hold him. When the long string is pulled Mr.
Frog will dance and play the mandolin.</p>

<h4><em>Paper Flowers</em></h4>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 99</span></p>

</div>

<p>Have you ever made paper flowers? If not, you
have probably seen them made by the cardboard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
patterns which dealers in tissue paper sell. How
about making the patterns yourself&mdash;for the poppies, daisies and
tulips and all the other flowers. It will be an interesting thing to
do and not difficult. Catch one of the poppy petals as it floats off
from the flower, blown by a summer breeze. Notice that there are only
four petals (if it is a single poppy), the two smaller ones setting
across the larger pair below. Poppies are charming and much simpler
than other flowers to copy in paper. You may have noticed that the
petals of the real ones look almost exactly like silky, crinkled
paper. Draw an outline of the petal a little larger than life on
heavy brown paper. Fold the paper back at the base of the petal and
cut it out in the two thicknesses so that it will look like Fig. 100.
The two lower petals will be cut in the same way but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
larger. You now have a pattern for as many poppies as you choose. They
can be made in various colours&mdash;white, red, pink, pink and white
and yellow. You can buy poppy centres ready to use, or if you prefer you
can make them yourself in this way: For a poppy four and a half inches
across, cut a circle of yellow paper an inch and a quarter in diameter.
Fringe the edge about half an inch. Next take a wire stem, bend the end
into a small circle, cover it with a tiny ball of cotton batting and
over this a piece of olive-green tissue paper, forming it to look as
much as possible like the real poppy centre (see Fig. 101).
Wind the edges of the paper close around the wire stem. Now run the
other end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span> of the stem down through the yellow circle,
brushing it with paste to attach it to the green part of the centre.
Slip the smaller pair of petals on the stem, then the larger pair (with
a little paste between), so that the smaller pair will set directly
across the larger. This completes the poppy. The stem is wound with
strips of olive-green tissue paper, and the leaves are cut from the same
paper by a pattern which you can easily make by laying a poppy leaf on a
sheet of cardboard and drawing around it with a sharp-pointed pencil.</p>

of deep-yellow tissue paper. Bend the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
corner over diagonally and cut a square four
by four inches. Next fold the paper in
the same way as for the petals described
in the Daisy Game in this chapter. Mark
on the top of the last fold a petal, as shown
in Fig. 83, and cut it out through all the
thicknesses. After it is unfolded you may
have to cut some of the petals up nearer
to the centre. Wind some brown worsted
around your thumb about twenty times, take
it off and run through it the end of a wire
stem which has been bent into a tiny crook.
Tie the worsted centre just above the wire
with a short piece of worsted, or bind it
with fine wire, and cut the loops at the
top. Now run the other end of the stem down
through the centre of the petals. Make a green
calyx like the one for the white daisy but much
smaller, not over an inch across. Wind the
stem with strips of olive-green tissue paper,
laying in every now and then a daisy leaf cut
from the same dark-green paper. Other single
flowers can be as easily made as this, and
you will find that the patterns will not be
difficult to make if you take the natural flowers
for your models.</p>

<p>Chrysanthemums are among the most natural
of paper flowers, and fascinating to make. White
ones are pretty, and those that are made of shades
of pink or yellow are even more attractive. Cut
the pattern shown in Fig. 102
from cardboard and lay it on
three thicknesses of medium
yellow tissue paper, seven and a
half inches square, which have
been folded diagonally three
times. Hold the pattern firmly
upon it and cut it out carefully.
Then in the same way cut two thicknesses of light-yellow
paper into petals. A piece of olive-green
tissue paper is folded into a smaller square and
cut in the same way, to make a calyx. To curl
the petals, put a small sofa cushion on your knee,
lay a petal upon it, and, taking a common hatpin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
with a smooth, round head, press it upon the end
of each petal up to the centre. This will curl it
as if by magic. Do another and another till the
whole piece is finished. Then curl a second piece
and a third in the same way. When they are all
done bend a long wire stem at one end and run the
other end through the centre of the petal-edged
pieces, which should be laid one above the other,
the darker ones on top. Put a touch of paste
between them, slip on the green calyx, wind
the stem with strips of green tissue paper, laying
in a chrysanthemum leaf from time to time, and
the flower is complete.</p>

<small>GAMES FOR TWO OR THREE TO PLAY</small></h2>

<p>On stormy days the children of a family are
likely to be alone&mdash;unless they are so fortunate
as to have a little visitor in the house, or a friend
who lives near wraps up and comes to play with
them. A child who is alone can read, or find in
the other chapters of this book some absorbing
occupation; for a party of children there are always
plenty of games, but it is sometimes difficult to
think of a game that two or three will enjoy. The
following are a few suggestions for such an emergency:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h4><em>Picture Puzzles</em></h4>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left"><strong>Materials Required: &nbsp; </strong></td><td align="left">As many pieces of cardboard about 6 by 8</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left"> &nbsp; &nbsp; inches as there are children,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">As many pairs of scissors as there are children,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">One or more tubes of paste,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">Several old magazines.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>There is such a fascination about cutting and
pasting that a game like this is one of the best you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
can choose for a dull day. Each child has an old
magazine, a piece of cardboard and a pair of scissors,
while tubes of paste lie conveniently near. When
the children are seated around a table the game
begins. It is played in this way: Each player
cuts from his magazine a picture (which must be
smaller than his card), pastes it upon his piece of
cardboard, and when it is dry and firm cuts it in
pieces with six straight cuts of the scissors, so as
to make a puzzle. He then mixes the pieces and
passes them to his neighbour on the right. At a
given signal each child tries to put the puzzle which
he has received together as quickly as possible.
The one who finishes first calls out that he is
through, and he is of course the winner.</p>

<p>As a sequel the children will enjoy colouring the
puzzles. If they are pretty and neatly made they
may be given to a child's hospital, to amuse some
other little children in the long days of convalescence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h4><em>How to Play the Daisy Game</em></h4>

<p>This is a good guessing game for two or more
children to play, and if you will follow the directions
given in chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_IX">IX.</a> you will find that it can be
made quite easily. None of the players should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
have seen the key, or answers to the conundrum,
but if you find that they have seen it, you can write
on the slips of paper, instead of the conundrums,
the names of flowers with the letters mixed for
example, sapyn, for pansy. Each child in turn
pulls a petal from the daisy and tries to guess the
name of the flower, which is the answer to the
conundrum written on the under side of the petal.
Five minutes is the time allowed, and if the
player has not guessed the flower in that time he
must pass the petal to the child on his left, who
also has five minutes in which to guess it. If he
guesses correctly the petal belongs to him, and
at the end of the game the player having the most
petals has won.</p>

<h4><em>Horses in the Stable</em></h4>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left"><strong>Materials Required: &nbsp; </strong></td><td align="left">A pasteboard shoe box,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">Some marbles,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">Pen and ink,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">Scissors.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Although this game is played with marbles,
girls as well as boys will enjoy it, and it is so easily
prepared that it can be played at short notice.
Take a long pasteboard box&mdash;a shoe box is about
the right size. Remove the cover and turn it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
upside down. Now, starting at the lower edge,
draw five doorways, like those shown in Fig. 103.
The one in the centre should be an inch across and
an inch and a half high, the two on each side of it
an inch and a half wide and two inches high, and
the outer ones each two inches wide and two and
a half inches high. Cut out these doorways with
a sharp, strong pair of scissors and mark over the
middle one in pen and ink the number 25. The
two on either side of it have marked above them 10,
and the other two each have 5. Stand the box,
or stable, thus prepared, against the wall and place
a mark four feet from it. Each player has three
marbles, and in turn tries to roll or shoot them
from the mark through the little doors into the box.
If he succeeds in putting one through the smallest
door he makes twenty-five; if through either of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
other doors his score is increased by the number
marked above it. There should be a time limit
for the game&mdash;half an hour, for example. The
score of each player, which is kept on a sheet of
paper, is added at the end of that time and the one
having the most points has won the game.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<h4><em>Plants and Flowers</em></h4>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left"><strong>Materials Required:</strong> &nbsp; </td><td align="left">As many pencils and sheets of paper as players,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">A large sheet of cardboard,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">Some seed catalogues,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">A tube of paste,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">Scissors.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Although a number of children can play this
game, two or three will enjoy it quite as well.
Any boy or girl can make it. You will need first
of all a number of seed catalogues. Cut from these
eighteen or twenty pictures of flowers and plants,
taking care not to leave the names on them. Write
in pencil, on the back of each, a number (any one
from 1 to 18) and the name&mdash;this is for your own
guidance later on. Now make a list of the flowers
and plants, each with its number before it. This
is the key, to be put away till after the game is
played. Take a large sheet of cardboard, about
twenty by twenty-four inches, and paste upon it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the flowers and plants in the order of their numbers,
marking the number of each clearly in pen
and ink underneath it. If you like you can colour
the pictures&mdash;this will make the game more attractive,
of course, and as you can use it many times
it is worth while. A loop of string, by which to
hang it, should be run through the top of the card
at the centre. When you are ready to play the
game hang the cardboard sheet where all can see it;
give each player a pencil and a piece of paper, on
the left side of which numbers from 1 to 18 have
been marked. Each child tries in the time
allowed&mdash;about twenty minutes&mdash;to guess the
names of the flowers and plants on the sheet or
cardboard, and write each opposite its number on
his piece of paper. The correct names are then
read from the key and the players check off their
guesses. The one who has guessed the greatest
number correctly is of course the winner.</p>

<h4><em>A Ball-and-Fan Race</em></h4>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left"><strong>Materials Required:</strong> &nbsp; </td><td align="left">2 Japanese paper balls,</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td align="left">2 palmleaf fans.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_238.png" width="351" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>A ball and fan race</p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Two children will find this race an interesting
one for a rainy day. The best place in which to
play it is a large room with very little furniture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
in it&mdash;a playroom for example. Each player
stands at a corner of the room diagonally opposite
the other, three feet out from the corner, and each
has a Japanese paper ball in front of him and a
large fan in his hand. They must face different
ways and both count together "One, two, three,
and away!" As they finish counting, the children
begin to fan their balls around the room, close to
the wall. There will be some lively skirmishing
when they meet, as they are likely to do when half
way around the room. Then each tries to send
his opponent's ball back and his own forward.
When each finally gets his ball back to the corner
where he started, he must try to send it as quickly
as possible to the middle of the room, where a chair
is placed. The ball must be fanned through the
legs of this chair and to the goal of his opponent.
The player who first accomplishes this is the
winner.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h4><em>Fun with Popcorn</em></h4>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left"><strong>Materials Required:</strong> &nbsp; </td><td align="left">An open fire,</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td align="left">A corn popper,</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td align="left">Several ears of popcorn,</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td align="left">A prize, if desired.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>If the open fire burns brightly in your playroom,
no matter how gray and bleak the day may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
outside, you and your brothers and sisters can
keep warm and cheerful over this delightful game.
You may provide a prize for the winner, if you like,
but the only things that are absolutely necessary
are the fire, some popcorn and a popper. When
the players are seated in a semicircle around the
fire they may all help in shelling the corn. After
this is done, divide the popcorn evenly between
them, so that each shall have a small quantity.
The player on the left side of the fireplace now
takes the corn popper and pops his corn. When
it is done, the kernels that are fully popped are
counted, also the unpopped ones, and a record is
made of each. The next player pops his corn and
counts the result, and so on until all have finished.
The child having the largest number of fully popped
kernels is the winner, and may receive a prize.
Afterward the winner and the defeated players will
equally enjoy eating the fluffy popcorn, or if the
cook is particularly amiable they may be allowed
to flock to the kitchen and make popcorn balls.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h4><em>Express</em></h4>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left"><strong>Materials Required:</strong> 12 or 15 articles, large and small, light and heavy.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This is a lively game that needs little preparation.
All you will have to provide is a number of articles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
toys, pieces of china (not valuable ones), a glass of
water, some very small things and one or more
large ones, something heavy like a dumb-bell or
flatiron and something light&mdash;a palmleaf fan, for
example. When you have them all collected, on a
table or stand on one side of the room where the
game is to be played, place another table or stand
across the room. Then you must have a clock or
a watch, and that is all&mdash;except the players.
Each child in turn takes one thing at a time, from
the stand where the various articles are piled, and
carries it to the table at the opposite side of the
room. It is done as quickly as possible, for the
object is to move everything from one place to
the other in the least possible time. Each
player is timed and his record kept on a
piece of paper. If a player drops anything
he must carry it back to the starting point
and make another trip with it. The next player
begins at the table to which the first one
took the baggage and carries it, in the same
way, back to the first table. So it goes on
until everyone has played expressman. The
player who succeeds in transferring the
baggage in the shortest time is, of course, the
winner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h4><em>A Hurdle Race</em></h4>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left"><strong>Materials Required:</strong> &nbsp; </td><td align="left">A box of tiddledywinks,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">A sheet of white cardboard,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">A box of watercolour paints,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">A pencil,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">Scissors,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">A ball of white string,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">Some pins.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The next time you are kept indoors by the
weather, you and a brother or sister may enjoy a
hurdle race. It is played with tiddledywink chips
and pasteboard hurdles on a large table or on the
floor. You can make the hurdles yourself. They
should be cut from cardboard, eight inches wide
and four inches high. Paint some of them with
wooden bars and others green&mdash;like high hedges.
In making the hurdles, cut the cardboard so that
a strip two inches deep by an inch across will
extend below each lower corner (see Fig. 104).
One of these is bent sharply forward at the place
marked by the dotted lines, the other is turned
back, forming stands to keep the hurdles upright.</p>

<p>The racecourse will have to be laid out on a
covered table or carpeted floor, as the tiddledywinks
can only be used on a soft, cushiony surface.
You can make the boundaries with white string,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
held in place here and there with pins. An oval
course, though more difficult to mark is rather
more exciting than a straight one, but either will
do. Have the course eight inches wide and as long
as you please. The hurdles may be placed where-ever
you choose, but be sure to have plenty of
them.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_244.png" width="500" height="368" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 104</span></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>When you are ready to begin, each player takes
a large tiddledywink chip and a small one of the
same colour&mdash;but different from his opponent's&mdash;and
at a signal given by a third person, who acts as
umpire, the race begins. Snap the tiddledywink
chip just as you do in playing the game, only taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
great care not to send it out of the course, for if it
goes outside the lines you must set it back three
inches. The umpire follows the race, of course,
and settles all disputed questions.</p>

<h4><i>Pictures from Fairy Tales</i></h4>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left"><strong>Materials Required:</strong> &nbsp; </td><td align="left">A number of old magazines,</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td align="left">Twice as many sheets of cardboard or heavy brown</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td align="left">As many pairs of scissors as there are children,</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td align="left">A tube of paste for each child.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Two or three children who know and love the old
fairy tales can spend a delightful hour playing this
game. Each one should have several old magazines
and a sheet of cardboard, as well as scissors
and a tube of paste. The leader, who may be one
of the children or an older person, explains the
game as follows: Each child is expected to make
a picture on his sheet of cardboard to illustrate
some fairy tale. It is not necessary to draw it;
he can cut from the magazines people and properties
and scenery and paste them upon the card.
He must be sure not to tell anyone the story he has
chosen. At the end of half an hour the pictures
should be finished. A bell is rung for everyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
to stop work and the pictures are placed where all
can see them. The leader now holds one up
before the children and asks them what story they
suppose it illustrates, and what particular part
of the story. The child who answers first wins the
picture. The other pictures are held up, one at a
time, and the children try to see who can guess
them first. If they are ready for another round of
the game after this one is finished, they may find
it amusing to vary it by making pictures from
"Mother Goose."</p>
